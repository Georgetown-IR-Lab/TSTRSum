weinberg inflation with a nonminimal coupling to gravity .<q>in this kind of model one usually finds that either the nonminimal coupling to gravity is large @xmath0 or the inflaton self - coupling is unnaturally small @xmath1 .<q>we have shown that the model is in agreement with the recent results from planck for natural values of the couplings .<q>inflation @xcite has become the standard paradigm for the early universe , because it solves some outstanding problems present in the standard hot big - bang cosmology , such as the flatness and horizon problems , the problem of unwanted relics , such as magnetic monopoles , and produces the cosmological fluctuations for the formation of the structure that we observe today .<q>the spectacular cmb data , first from the wmap satellite @xcite and recently from planck @xcite , have strengthen the inflationary idea , since the observations indicate an _ almost _ scale - free spectrum of gaussian adiabatic density fluctuations , just as predicted by simple models of inflation .<q>however , inflation is not a theory yet , as we do nt know how to integrate it with ideas from particle physics .<q>the brout - englert - higgs mechanism @xcite in the framework of the standard model breaks electroweak symmetry , gives masses to the charged fermions and the massive gauge bosons , and predicts the existence of the higgs boson .<q>the recent lhc discovery of the higgs boson @xcite completed the particle spectrum predicted by the standard model , and indicates for the first time that fundamental scalar particles exist in nature .<q>therefore , it is a natural thing to assume that inflation is driven by the higgs boson .<q>although the higgs potential is not suitable for a viable inflationary model , the presence of a higgs non - minimal coupling to gravity can change things to the better .<q>a large value of the non - minimal coupling @xmath2 is required , and given the uncertainties in the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant the model is still allowed @xcite .<q>sadly , that large value of @xmath3 questions the validity of the scenario in the sm higgs inflation , as the inflationary scale exceeds the effective ultraviolet cut - off scale @xcite .<q>as it was realized long ago , radiative corrections can be the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .<q>the coleman - weinberg mechanism can not work in the standard model due to the large value of the top yukawa coupling , but it can work in models beyond the standard model @xcite .<q>this is an interesting possibility given the higgs naturalness problem , in the following sense .<q>if heavy particles are coupled to the higgs boson , like in gut models , then the higgs receives large radiative corrections that bring its mass close to the gut mass scale .<q>supersymmetry at the tev scale can solve the problem , but given the severe experimental constraints on the masses of the superpartners , it was proposed recently the flatland scenario @xcite , according to which electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively a la coleman - weinberg in the infrared region starting from a flat scalar potential in the ultraviolet region .<q>regarding inflation , the coleman - weinberg type of potential is a simple and well motivated one , since it naturally arises when loop corrections are taken into account , and it is typical for the new inflation scenario @xcite where inflation takes place near the maximum .<q>recently it has been studied in @xcite in a b - l extension of the standard model , and a few years ago in @xcite in a gut inflationary model .<q>as shown in @xcite in the context of the effective theory of inflation , cosmic microwave background together with large scale structure data prefer double - well inflaton potentials .<q>the 2013 planck data confirmed this result , and not surprisingly the coleman - weinberg potential considered here belongs to this class , and succeeds to reproduce the @xmath4 value and the r bound from the 2013 planck release .<q>however , in @xcite the inflaton was minimally coupled to gravity .<q>setting @xmath5 , although it is a popular choice , is often unacceptable as was pointed out in @xcite .<q>non - minimal couplings are generated by quantum corrections even if they are absent in the classical action @xcite , and as a matter of fact the coupling is required if the scalar field theory is to be renormalizable in a classical gravitational background @xcite .<q>for early works on non - minimal inflation see for example @xcite and references therein .<q>in the present brief report we imagine a scenario where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of some particle physics model beyond the standard model in which electroweak symmetry breaking takes place radiatively a la coleman and weinberg .<q>since the scale of inflation is close to the gut scale , we consider a gut model rather than a low energy one , and we also allow for a non - vanishing non - minimal coupling , as required by the quantum corrections already needed to give rise to the coleman - weinberg type of the inflaton potential .<q>we find that the model is viable as it is in agreement with the recent data from planck , and even more importantly for natural values of the parameters of the model .<q>we start defining the model by the action @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the non - minimal coupling and @xmath8 with a coleman - weinberg type of potential of the standard form @xcite @xmath9 where a is related to the inflaton quartic self - coupling @xcite , and m is the inflaton vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at the minimum , @xmath10 .<q>the vacuum energy density at the origin is given by the constant term @xmath11 so that @xmath12 , and the shape of the potential can be seen in figure 1 , and the inflaton mass is given by @xmath13 .<q>at this point we stress the fact that the coleman - weinberg potential considered in the present work is the standard one obtained from one - loop corrections in minkowski spacetime .<q>the one - loop corrections in de sitter spacetime ( which approximates an inflationary background ) lead to a very different effective potential as shown in @xcite .<q>[ cols=\^,^ \ , ] in summary , in this brief report we have considered a gut inflationary model where inflation is driven by the scalar sector of the model with a coleman - weinberg type of potential for the inflaton and a non - minimal coupling of the inflaton to gravity .<q>as is known , at tree level the @xmath14 potential can not trigger electroweak symmetry breaking , and in addition the corresponding chaotic inflationary model @xmath15 is ruled out by the wmap and planck data .<q>however , quantum loop corrections modify the inflaton potential and at the same time generate the non - minimal coupling term .<q>the model is characterized by two dimensionless parameters , namely the non - minimal coupling @xmath7 and the inflaton quartic self - coupling @xmath16 .<q>we have shown that the model leads to predictions in agreement with the 95 per cent cl contours in the r-@xmath4 plane for natural values of the parameters of the model , both for @xmath7 and @xmath16 of the order of @xmath17 ."

segments lie within @xmath291% of the mean , in agreement with the 1% variation in the outer diameter of the fibre that was achieved during fabrication .[numerical reconstruction of pcf structure] in conclusion , we have demonstrated a technique for determining the degree of structural variation in pcf by measuring seeded fwm and carrying out a numerical reconstruction .[conclusion] hence we infer the level of variation in our pcf to be below @xmath30 and the length scale of the variations to be around 15 cm . not only can these methods be used to determine the suitability of pcf samples for use in high - purity heralded single photon sources , where any inhomogeneity in the fibre introduces additional unwanted spectral correlations in the two - photon state , but also in other uses of pcf , for example in bright fwm sources that require high spectral brightness .[conclusion],","we present a method by which the degree of longitudinal variation in photonic crystal fibre ( pcf ) may be characterised through seeded four - wave mixing ( fwm ) .<q>using an iterative numerical reconstruction , we created a model pcf that displays similar fwm phasematching properties across all measured length scales .<q>our results demonstrate that the structure of our pcf varies by less than @xmath0 and that the characteristic length of the variations is approximately 15 cm .<q>+ * ocis<q>* : ( 060.5295 ) photonic crystal fibers ; ( 060.2270 ) fiber characterization ; ( 190.4380 ) nonlinear optics , four -

"in this paper , we will continue our study of the effects on massive accretion disk evolution due to the continued infall from bondi - hoyle accretion .[introduction] this problem is of general interest to systems in which the mass influx is not planar at the disk s outer edge , but rather originates from a 3-dimensional distribution of wind sources .[introduction] an example is the formation and evolution of a protostellar disk , or a disk embedded within a cluster of stellar wind sources , such as may be the case for the black hole candidate sgr a * at the galactic center .[introduction] in our application , 3d hydrodynamic simulations of the bondi - hoyle infall are used to provide more realistic profiles of the accreted mass , temperature , and specific angular momentum as functions of radius .[introduction] these profiles are incorporated into the one - dimensional equations for the temporal evolution of accretion disks with wind infall developed in @xcite ( paper i ) .[introduction] spectral and kinematic studies suggest that the powerful nonthermal radio source sgr a * , located at the center of the milky way , is a supermassive compact object with a mass @xmath1 .[introduction] sgr a * appears to be the ideal case for applying the concept of _ any _ large , stable accretion disk fed by quasi - spherical accretion since the disk acts as a resevoir for the infalling plasma , thereby decreasing the expected conversion efficiency and luminosity .[introduction] thus , although we discuss both in this paper , our quantitative results for the impact of a wind infall on the disk s evolution , apply primarily to the former .[introduction] it has been suggested ( @xcite , @xcite ) that sgr a * might be surrounded by a large , slowly accreting , fossil disk , perhaps formed from the remnants of a tidally - disrupted star that ventured too close to the black hole .[introduction] in both cases , one expects that the large - scale bondi - hoyle inflow must be captured and incorporated into the fossil disk .[introduction] . some of the results discussed in this paper , particularly the kinetic energy dissipated and radiated as the infalling wind impacts the plane , will be valid in a qualitative sense for this type of disk just as they are for a fossilized structure .[introduction] we have also considered the likely effect on the disk s stability due to this infall , and based on our results , we concluded that a disk will probably rotate in time until its symmetry axis is perpendicular to the incoming wind flow direction .[conclusions and possible applications] an additional rather robust result of our simulations is that the emitted spectrum of a wind - fed disk can be observationally distinct from that of a pure shakura - sunyaev flow .[conclusions and possible applications] we have considered the possibility that sgr a * may be surrounded by a fossil disk accreting at a rate of @xmath139yr@xmath7 , while intercepting an infalling wind of @xmath140yr@xmath7 .[conclusions and possible applications] we have found that , for the wind configuration we have considered here , the predicted infrared luminosity is more than 3 orders of magnitude greater than the observational limits .[conclusions and possible applications],","in this paper , we will continue our study of the effects on massive accretion disk evolution due to the continued infall from bondi -

eddington for a million solar mass object , the accreting gas is mostly unimpeded by the escaping radiation field and is thus essentially in hydrodynamic free - fall starting at @xmath15 . our initial numerical simulations of this process , assuming a highly simplistic uniform flow past a @xmath16 point mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have verified these expectations . whether or not this accretion is mediated via an accretion disk or it constitutes a more or less quasi - spherical infall depends critically on the specific angular momentum carried by the captured gas .[introduction] thus , although we discuss both in this paper , our quantitative results for the impact of a wind infall on the disk s evolution , apply primarily to the former .[introduction] depending on the strength of such a disruption , as much as half of the stellar mass may be left as a remnant surrounding the black hole ( @xcite and references cited therein ) .[introduction] in both cases , one expects that the large - scale bondi - hoyle inflow must be captured and incorporated into the fossil disk .[introduction] the large scale simulations show that most of the wind that reaches the central @xmath77 is post - shock gas flowing in the -z direction .[the hydrodynamical simulations] we can now use the results of the 3d hydrodynamical calculations to determine the temporal evolution of an accretion disk subject to a wind infall . here[the disk evolution with a hydrodynamic wind infall] the effect on the radiated spectrum is predictable : the impact of the low - angular momentum wind on the fossil disk leads to an immediate release of energy at large radii where most of the mass is deposited .[the disk evolution with a hydrodynamic wind infall] thus , based on our application to the galactic center source , sgr a * , our results would seem to argue against there being any type of large scale disk ( i.e. , with radius @xmath147 ) feeding the central mass concentration , and that instead the inflow into this object probably swirls toward small radii without ever forming a stable , flattened configuration .[conclusions and possible applications],","in the first paper of this series , using analytic tools , we examined how the evolution and structure of a massive accretion disk may be influenced significantly by the deposition of mass and angular momentum by an infalling bondi - hoyle wind .<q>such a mass influx impacts the long - term behavior of the disk by providing additional sources of viscosity and heating .<q>in this paper , we make a significant improvement over this earlier work by incorporating the results of 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the large scale accretion from an ambient medium into the disk evolution equations developed previously .<q>we discuss in detail two models , one with the axis of the disk parallel to , and the second with the axis oriented perpendicular to the large scale bondi - hoyle flow .<q>we find that the mass inflow rate onto the disk within logarithmic annuli is roughly constant with radius and that the impacting wind carries much less specific angular momentum than keplerian .<q>we also find , in general , that the infrared spectrum of a wind - fed disk system is steeper than that of a shakura - sunyaev configuration , due mainly to the dissipation of the wind s kinetic energy at the disk s surface .<q>in applying our results to the galactic center black hole candidate , sgr a * , accreting from nearby stellar winds , we demonstrate that a high wind inflow rate of order @xmath0 per year can not be incorporated into a fossil disk without a significant dissipation of kinetic energy at all radii .<q>such a high dissipation would violate current infrared and near -

ray band , summarizing the temporal and spectral indices expected in the x - ray band for both the ism and the wind models .[introduction] the temporal bridge between the grb prompt emission and the afterglow emission is essential for revealing whether the prompt emission and the afterglow originate from the same component .[grb tail emission and the curvature effect] it is one of the major tasks of _ swift _ to pin down the emission site of the grb prompt emission .[grb tail emission and the curvature effect] we suggest that most of the rapid - decay lightcurves observed by the _ swift _ xrt may be interpreted as grb ( or x - ray flare ) tail emission through the curvature effect , with the first two adjustments discussed above . in order to test this hypothesis , after the submission of this paper we have performed more detailed data analyses on a large sample of xrt bursts ( liang et al .[grb tail emission and the curvature effect] it is found that @xmath0 is usually at the beginning of the last pulse ( for the steep decay following the prompt emission ) or at the beginning of the x - ray flare ( for steep decay following flares ) .[grb tail emission and the curvature effect] we suggest that these breaks are likely not `` jet breaks '' .[conclusions] rather they mark the cessation of an early continuous energy injection phase during which the external shock is refreshed .[conclusions] we suggest three possible physical mechanisms for the refreshed shocks , i.e. a long - lived central engine with a decaying luminosity , a power law distribution of the shell lorentz factors before deceleration begins , and the deceleration of a high-@xmath99 flow .[conclusions] \\4 . in the `` normal '' phase ,[conclusions] the data for many bursts are consistent with an ism medium rather than a wind medium .[conclusions] this has important implications for understanding the massive star progenitors of long grbs , including their late evolution stage shortly before explosion .[conclusions] given that most of the shallow - to - normal transitions are due to the cessation of the refreshed shock phase , the cases with a well - identified jet break are not very common .[conclusions] the x - ray flares detected in nearly half of the _ swift _ bursts are most likely due to late central engine activity , which results in internal shocks ( or similar energy dissipation events ) at later times .[conclusions],","with the successful launch of the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst explorer , a rich trove of early x - ray afterglow data has been collected by its on - board x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .<q>some interesting features are emerging , including a distinct rapidly decaying component preceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources , a shallow decay component before the more ` ` normal '' decay component observed in a good fraction of grbs ( e.g. grb 050128 , grb 050315 , grb 050319 , and grb 050401 ) , and x - ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows ( e.g. grb 050406 , grb 050502b , grb 050607 , and grb 050724 ) .<q>these interesting early afterglow signatures reveal valuable and unprecedented information about grbs , including the prompt emission - afterglow transition , grb emission site , central engine activity , forward - reverse shock physics , and the grb immediate environment .<q>in this paper , we systematically analyze the possible physical processes that shape the properties of the early x - ray afterglow lightcurves , and use the data to constrain various models .<q>we suggest that the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the prompt gamma - ray bursts and/or of the x - ray flares .<q>this provides strong evidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are likely two distinct components , supporting the internal origin of the grb prompt emission .<q>the shallow decay segment observed in a group of grbs suggests that very likely the forward shock keeps being refreshed for some time .<q>this might be caused either by a long - lived central engine , or by a wide distribution of the shell lorentz factors , or else possibly by the deceleration of a poynting flux dominated flow .<q>x - ray flares suggest that the grb central engine is very likely still active after the prompt gamma - ray emission is over , but with a reduced activity at later times .<q>in some cases , the central engine activity even extends to days after the burst triggers .<q>analyses of early x - ray afterglow data reveal that grbs are indeed highly relativistic events , and that early afterglow data of many bursts , starting from the beginning of the xrt observations , are consistent with the afterglow emission from an interstellar medium ( ism ) environment ."

"the detailed study of the spatiotemporal evolution of the non - stationary plasma fluctuations , observed at different timescales , allows a 2d reconstruction of the wavelet power which maps the outer corona from 1.4 to @xmath6 in a systematic manner and over a time interval of 9 days .[introduction] the present analysis is based on white - light images of the outer solar corona obtained during the minimum of solar activity in 2008 with the coronagraph cor1-a , which is part of the secchi ( sun - earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ) instrument suite aboard the ahead spacecraft of the twin stereo ( solar terrestrial relations observatory ) satellites .[observations] in this paper we adopt the wavelet analysis with the aim to identify periodic and quasi -

stokes equation ( with boundary conditions ) are formidable dynamical systems , possessing and being able to exploit large oscillatory capabilities through generalized landau scenarios of high @xmath0 and @xmath26 values .[conjectures on the onset of turbulence] we also conjecture that this is so because their structure of feedback interdependences contain proper nonlinearities and competitions , as well as because their usual control parameter activates the nonlinear mechanisms in a continuously increasing way that develops the landau scenario properly . in eq . 3 , but unlike what is usual in the investigation of dynamical systems , @xmath149 acts as an effective scale factor on all the dynamical nonlinearities of any fluid flow .[conjectures on the onset of turbulence] we consider the dynamic brain as a high - dimensional dynamical system with the proper structure and parameter values needed to sustain states of a high degree of oscillatory instability , like those we associate with the generalized landau scenario .[hypothesis for a dynamic brain],","this paper may be ultimately described as an attempt to make feasible the evolutionary emergence of novelty in a supposedly deterministic world whose behavior is associated with that of the mathematical dynamical systems .<q>it means philosophical implications that the paper needs to address , subsidiarily at least .<q>the work was motivated by the observation of complex oscillatory behaviors in a family of physical devices and related mathematical models , for which there is no known explanation in the mainstream of nonlinear dynamics .<q>the paper begins by describing a nonlinear mechanism of oscillatory mode mixing explaining such behaviors and , through its generalization to richer nonlinear vector fields , establishes a generic dynamical scenario with extraordinary oscillatory possibilities , including expansive growing scalability toward high dimensionalities .<q>the scenario is then tentatively used to explain complex oscillatory behaviors observed in nature like those of turbulent fluids and living brains .<q>finally , by considering the scenario as a dynamic substrate underlying generic aspects of both the functioning and the genesis of complex behaviors in a supposedly deterministic world , a theoretical framework covering the evolutionary development of structural transformations in the time evolution of that world is built up .<q>the analysis includes attempts to clarify the roles of items often invoked apropos of pathways to complexity like chaos , pattern formation , externally - driven bifurcations , hysteresis , irreversibility , and order through random fluctuations .<q>thermodynamics , as the exclusive field of physics in providing generic evolutionary criteria , is briefly and synthetically considered from the dynamical systems point of view , in an effort to elucidate its explanatory possibilities concerning the emergence of complexity .<q>quantum mechanics gets involved in two different ways : the lack of a dynamical systems perspective in the currently accepted interpretations of that fundamental theory and the indeterminacy issues , and both questions are discussed to point out their consequences .<q>the reported evolutionary framework is far from a complete theory but includes both the elements and the skeleton for its tentative building within feasible philosophical grounds .<q>advisory caution is needed in distinguishing what is robust from what is not and also in appreciating the overall consistency of the several sides of the analysis , to which we attribute its main strength .<q>in the lack of alternatives , one should imagine how could be one of such theories and how it could be built , in order to evaluate our approach .<q>in particular , notice that our approach is to a theory of nothing of the physical world but of the underlying reasons for its ordered functioning , which we interpret independent of that world , i.e. , a theory of what the catalan expression ` ` lentrellat del mn '' describes so well .<q>complex oscillations .<q>nonlinear mode mixing .<q>evolutionary mechanism .<q>brain oscillations .<q>turbulence ."

"our particular goal is to characterize ysos in the galaxy using the glimpse and mipsgal surveys , as well as in the lmc using the sage survey , and to determine the timescales of various evolutionary stages as a function of stellar mass and location in the galaxy .[introduction] ultimately , we hope to provide an independent estimate of the star formation rate and efficiency in the galaxy and the lmc . to help analyze the seds of ysos we developed radiation transfer models @xcite . the well - known classification for low - mass ysos uses the spectral index @xmath5 ( the slope of @xmath6 vs @xmath7 longward of @xmath8@xmath3 m ) to classify a source as embedded ( @xmath9 ; class i ) , a disk source ( @xmath10 ; class ii ) or a source with an optically thin or no disk ( @xmath11 ; class iii ) @xcite[introduction] in addition , the temperature of the central source also affects the colors in this wavelength range , as does the location of the inner radius of the disk : hot stellar sources and large inner disk holes can produce red colors in a star+disk source ( see section [ s : color ] ) . in an attempt to improve our physical understanding gained from interpreting the seds of the many sources found in these surveys , many of which only have jhk , irac , and mips 24@xmath3 m data , we plan to fit observed seds using a large grid of pre -

", it is now possible to achieve a physical description of black hole accretion that is much more complete .[introduction] using this code we have simulated accretion flows onto black holes with four different spin parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .[introduction] these runs were labeled kd0 , kdi , kdp , and kde in the first paper of this series ( de villiers , hawley , & krolik 2003 , hereafter paper i ) , which presented both a detailed description of how these simulations were done and an introduction to the several distinct physical regimes found within the accretion flows . in this paper[introduction] we continue our report on these simulations with a discussion of the structure of the magnetic field . before presenting this report[introduction] we adopt geometrodynamic units @xmath4 ( misner , thorne , & wheeler , 1973 ) , and express evolution times in terms of black hole mass @xmath5 .[introduction] high -

dependence of the currents suggests that magnetic dissipation may be especially intense in accretion flows near extreme black holes .[discussion and summary],","accretion onto black holes is potentially the most efficient form of energy generation possible ; it is expected that as much as several tens of percent of the rest -

free condition met . in the main disk body and most of the inner torus ,[distribution of magnetic pressure] we examine the overall geometry and global connectivity of the magnetic field in these simulations .[field geometry] we begin our description of the field geometry with the main body of the disk , which consists , as anticipated , of turbulent , tangled toroidal fields ( type 1 ) . in the main disk body , the field geometry is controlled by two effects : orbital shear and turbulence .[field geometry] the main disk body is characterized by mhd turbulence due to the mri . as has been shown in previous studies , the magnetic field is very tightly wound by the differential rotation , but with significant poloidal tangling due to turbulence . the field wandering index shows that the poloidal field lines extend farther in the radial direction than in the polar .[discussion and summary] the growth of magnetic pressure is due in part to the dragging of field lines by the black hole , and in part to the inward displacement of the marginally stable orbit with black hole spin , which tends to allow the mri to operate closer to the event horizon .[discussion and summary] there is also a strong spin - dependent growth in the intensity of currents in the vicinity of the black hole . in the @xmath54 , 0.5 , and 0.9 simulations ,[discussion and summary] this strong spin - dependence of the currents suggests that magnetic dissipation may be especially intense in accretion flows near extreme black holes .[discussion and summary],","we present a detailed analysis of the magnetic field structure found in a set of four general relativistic 3d mhd simulations of accreting tori in the kerr metric with different black hole spins .<q>among the properties analyzed are the field strength as a function of position and black hole spin , the shapes of field lines , the degree to which they connect different regions , and their degree of tangling .<q>strong magnetic field is found toward small radii , and field strength increases with black hole spin .<q>in the main disk body , inner torus , and corona the field is primarily toroidal .<q>most field lines passing through a given radius in these regions wander through a narrow radial range , suggesting an overall tightly - wound spiral structure .<q>in the main disk body and inner torus sharp field line bends on small spatial scales are superimposed on the spirals , but the field lines are much smoother in the corona .<q>the magnetic field in the plunging region is also comparatively smooth , being stretched out radially by the infalling gas .<q>the magnetic field in the axial funnel resembles a split monopole , but with evidence of frame dragging of the field lines near the poles of the black hole .<q>we investigate prior speculations about the structure of the magnetic fields and discuss how frequently certain configurations are seen in the simulations .<q>for example , coronal loops are very rare and field lines connecting high latitudes on the event horizon to the disk are not found at all .<q>almost the entire system is matter - dominated ; the only force - free regions are in the axial funnel .<q>we also analyze the distribution of current density , with a view toward identifying possible locations for magnetic energy dissipation .<q>regions of high current density are concentrated toward the inner torus and plunging region .<q>dissipation inside the marginally stable orbit may provide a new source of energy for radiation , supplementing the dissipation associated with torques in the stably - orbiting disk body ."

reactive fluid medium creates a plume .<q>the flux can be provided by either heat , a compositional difference between the fluid comprising the plume and its surroundings , or a combination of both .<q>for autocatalytic plumes produced by the iodate - arsenous acid reaction , however , buoyancy is produced along the entire reacting interface between the plume and its surroundings .<q>buoyancy production at the moving interface drives fluid motion , which in turn generates flow that advects the reaction front .<q>as a consequence of this interplay between fluid flow and chemical reaction , autocatalytic plumes exhibit a rich dynamics during their ascent through the reactant medium .<q>one of the more interesting dynamical features is the production of an accelerating vortical plume head that in certain cases pinches - off and detaches from the upwelling conduit .<q>after pinch - off , a new plume head forms in the conduit below , and this can lead to multiple generations of plume heads for a single plume initiation .<q>we investigated the pinch - off process using both experimentation and simulation .<q>experiments were performed using various concentrations of glycerol , in which it was found that repeated pinch - off occurs exclusively in a specific concentration range .<q>autocatalytic plume simulations revealed that pinch - off is triggered by the appearance of accelerating flow in the plume conduit .<q>[ intro ] plumes are organized flow structures of considerable importance @xcite due to their widespread natural occurrence , particularly in geophysical flows @xcite .<q>a plume can be _ steady _ , in the case when the flow structure is well - developed and is no longer time - dependent , or it can be _ starting _ , in the transient case where buoyant fluid is penetrating the medium into which it is growing .<q>the majority of work on plumes has focused on the steady variety , since the persistence of the columnar conduit following behind the head plays a significant role in many geophysical processes .<q>long - lived plume conduits are believed to underlie the formation of mantle hot spots , such as the one responsible for the hawaiian island - emperor seamount chain @xcite .<q>we will consider autocatalytic starting plumes in this paper .<q>before a laminar starting plume reaches a steady state , it develops its most prominent feature : an evolving head encompassing a vortex ring .<q>usually , the plume head remains attached to the conduit and the conduit remains linked to the buoyancy source @xcite .<q>vortex rings are the subject of a vast literature and have a rich history @xcite .<q>they can be produced experimentally by using a piston to transiently inject a finite volume of neutrally buoyant fluid into quiescent surroundings @xcite , a technique is similar to the vortex ring generator pioneered by p. g. tait in the nineteenth century @xcite .<q>_ pinch - off _ refers to the process by which the vortex ring detaches from its source .<q>in addition to neutrally buoyant scenarios , vortex ring formation and pinch - off has also been investigated in the context of buoyant starting plumes , where results suggest that dimensionless circulation of the ring is a universal quantity , regardless of whether it is produced by pinch - off from a plume head or formed by a piston @xcite .<q>essentially free buoyant vortex rings can also be created by the pinch - off of plume heads driven by an autocatalytic chemical reaction @xcite .<q>nonlinear chemical kinetics can produce fronts of reaction which are advected by the buoyancy - driven flow created by the reaction itself @xcite .<q>this ` ` self - stirring '' can , in turn , increase the production of the product species and change the morphology of the reaction front .<q>in a container with a relatively unconfined geometry , the localized initiation of a nonlinear autocatalytic reaction creates a special sort of reacting plume @xcite .<q>such plumes can be viewed as weakly driven versions of expanding flame fronts , such as the flame ` ` bubbles '' that detonate type ia supernovae @xcite .<q>unlike supernovae , autocatalytic plumes are readily produced and studied in the laboratory @xcite .<q>this paper describes experimental and numerical investigations on the behavior of autocatalytic plumes produced by the propagating front of the iodate - arsenous acid ( iaa ) reaction @xcite , focusing on the pinch - off process .<q>the iaa reaction produces buoyancy - driven flow by its exothermicity and by the isothermal density difference between its reactant and product solutions @xcite .<q>we explore the effect of adding glycerol to the iaa solution on autocatalytic plume morphology and dynamics .<q>addition of glycerol increases the viscosity of the solution , and it slows the rate of diffusion of the autocatalyst .<q>we found that pinch - off behavior is most prevalent in a specific window of glycerol concentration .<q>plumes produced with glycerol concentrations outside this window did not produce multiple pinch - off events .<q>to complement the experiments , we constructed an axisymmetric numerical simulation of autocatalytic plume dynamics and used it to examine the development of the reaction - driven flow that leads to pinch - off .<q>we conclude by identifying the subtle processes in the head and conduit that lead up to pinch - off events ."

dimensional space . and[numerical setup] in this paper , we have explored the stable geometry for a system with two planets involved in a 2:1 mmr , and we mainly concentrate on the study of the hd 82943 system by adopting two different sets of the orbital parameters . in our numerical simulations , we found there are three possible stable configurations for hd 82943 system:(1)type i , only @xmath1 , ( 2)type ii , @xmath2 ( aligned case ) , and ( 3)type iii , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( antialigned case ) .[summary and remarks] , we also proposed a semi - analytical model to study the @xmath11 hamiltonian contour determined by the initial parameters , and the closest level curves encompass the direct numerical results , which presents a good agreement between them .[summary and remarks] the theoretical figures can still provide valuable information on the dynamics for two planets . given the stable geometry based on fit 2[summary and remarks] , we then extensively examined the dependence of the stability of hd 82943 in the orbital parameter space and the planetary mass ratios . in the case of the non - coplanar circumstances[summary and remarks] , we found that stability requires that the relative inclination be @xmath12 or less .[summary and remarks] for a fixed planetary mass ratio @xmath18 , the stable orbits for hd 82943 requires @xmath13 . for the non - constant mass ratio case ( where @xmath15 is kept ) ,[summary and remarks] the requirement of the stability is @xmath97/@xmath199 , which indicates an upper boundary for the mass of the inner planet .[summary and remarks] concerning the eccentricities , the system can be always steady when @xmath256 and @xmath17 . in a word , these outcomes do demonstrate that the stability for hd 82943 is strongly sensitive to the sound planetary masses , rather lower relative inclination between two orbits , the eccentricities and other orbital parameters .[summary and remarks] in addition , we showed that the assumed terrestrial bodies can not exist in the habitable zones of hd 82943 thanks to strong perturbations induced by two massive planets , but the earth - like planets can be dynamically habitable in the gj 876 system at @xmath18 au in the numerical surveys .[summary and remarks] however , as the additional measurements will improve the present best - fit solution for hd 82943 with a corrected model by taking into account the planet - planet interactions .[summary and remarks] thus , we hope to have more precise orbital solution not only to check for our presented predictions in this paper but to better make sense of the complete dynamics and the origin of this system in the near future .[summary and remarks],","we have numerically explored the stable planetary geometry for the multiple systems involved in a 2:1 mean motion resonance , and herein we mainly concentrate on the study of the hd 82943 system by employing two sets of the orbital parameters ( mayor et al . 2004 ) .<q>in the simulations , we find that all stable orbits are related to the 2:1 commensurability that can help to remain the semi - major axes for two companions almost unaltered over the secular evolution for @xmath0 yr , and the apsidal phase - locking between two orbits can further enhance the stability for this system , because the eccentricities are simultaneously preserved to restrain the planets from frequent close encounters .<q>for hd 82943 , there exist three possible stable configurations:(1 ) type i , only @xmath1 , ( 2 ) type ii , @xmath2 ( aligned case ) , and ( 3 ) type iii , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( antialigned case ) , here the lowest eccentricity - type mean motion resonant arguments are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the relative apsidal longitudes @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 are , respectively , the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planets;@xmath10 are the longitudes of periapse ) .<q>and we find that the other 2:1 resonant systems ( e.g. , gj 876 or hd 160691 ) may possess one of three stable orbits in their realistic motions .<q>in addition , we also propose a semi - analytical model to study @xmath11 hamiltonian contours , which are fairly consistent with direct numerical integrations .<q>with the updated fit , we then examine the dependence of the stability of this system on the relative inclination , the planetary mass ratios , the eccentricities and other orbital parameters : in the non - coplanar cases , we find that stability requires the relative inclination being @xmath12 or less ; as to the planetary mass ratio , the stable orbits for hd 82943 requires @xmath13 for a fixed value or @xmath14 where @xmath15 remains for the varying mass ratio ; concerning the eccentricities , the system can be always steady when @xmath16 and @xmath17 .<q>moreover , we numerically show that the assumed terrestrial bodies can not survive near the habitable zones for hd 82943 due to the strong perturbations induced by two resonant companions , but these low - mass planets can be dynamically habitable in the gj 876 system at @xmath18 au in the numerical surveys .<q>finally , we present a brief discussion on the origin of the 2:1 resonance for hd 82943 ."
