goldstone boson, corresponding to the broken time translation invariance of the parent theory, is shown to be the salient book - keeping device around which successive terms in the derivative expansion naturally organize themselves. by explicitly integrating out the heavy modes, we are able to deduce an effective theory valid to all orders in field perturbations, and which reduces the effective speed of sound for the long wavelength quasi - long wavelengths. when the trajectory of the inflaton is parametrized by the radius of curvature in field space, the resulting eft describes the physics of the underlying parent theory to very high accuracy. in particular, we show that the coupling of the eft expansion to the background inflaton trajectory is strongly dependent on the background trajectory and the mass of the heavy fields that couple to it, generating large levels of primordial non - gaussianity consistent with slow - roll, in contrast to the naive expectation that this variation can be slowly - rolled. by contrast, the perturbative expansion itself can vary rapidly enough ( i.e., too slowly ) in time to cause the lagrangian of the trajectory to change form, violating gauge invariance, even in the limit of large eft amplitudes. these features are signatures of the transient nature of the relevant interactions in the theory, and suggest that additional, potentially observable, effects of these interactions might be detectable. in what follows, we attempt to elucidate further the features of this single field eft approach through a generalization of the framework introduced in a previous paper, with the goal of relating the low energy eft to cosmological observables.",0.223583460949464,"the application of effective field theory ( eft ) techniques to the study of cosmic inflation , constitutes a powerful and systematic approach through which we can calibrate and account for our ignorance of the laws of physics relevant during the very early universe @xcite ( see also ref . trans - planckian concerns notwithstanding @xcite , in many circumstances , from the perspective of the parent theory we are forced to account for the other scales present in the system , which turn out to manifest in the low energy eft in an interesting manner . how much the trajectory deviates off the adiabatic minimum is a function of the mass of the heavy fields which couple to the inflaton , the inflaton velocity ( which must remain consistent with slow - roll ) , and the radius of curvature , @xmath9 , of the trajectory in field space . our goal in this paper is to elucidate the general structure , to all orders in perturbations , of the eft for the adiabatic mode of a theory described by a single effective scalar minimally coupled to gravity at low energies a situation that might be dynamically preferred @xcite . in doing so , we have to be mindful of the fact that notions of adiabaticity have to be generalized to account for the fact that the motion of the inflaton through field space can readily force it off its adiabatic minimum , without interrupting slow - roll , even as the scale of inflation remains far below the scale of heavy physics @xmath8 , and in spite of which a low energy eft description is available and describes the physics of the light modes to the appropriate accuracy . we will show that the couplings of the eft are parametrized entirely in terms of the reduced speed of sound @xmath14 , which we compute in terms of the parameters of the parent theory . qualifying the expectation that @xmath14 can at most be a slowly varying function of time @xcite , or that it can not become too small without violating perturbative unitarity @xcite , we find that it is entirely consistent to have _ transiently _ small speeds of sound induced by _ transient _ strong couplings of various operators in the eft expansion . these are readily generated by turns in the parent theory that cause the background inflaton to deviate off its adiabatic minimum . in spite of this , we are still able to write down an effective theory that captures the relevant physics of the adiabatic mode with the appropriate accuracy , which forces us to consider a generalized notion of adiabaticity that determines the validity of our eft . this generalization is mandated by the fact that there are two distinct ways in which the low energy description accounts for deviations of the inflaton trajectory off its adiabatic minimum in the parent theory . in what follows we attempt to further our understanding of the structure of the single field effective theory derived from parent theories with a single light inflaton among multiple other fields with masses much larger than the scale of inflation . by analyzing the terms of the derivative expansion that emerge from integrating out heavy degrees of freedom , we show that the speed of sound @xmath14 for the adiabatic perturbations emerges as _ the _ salient book -

scalar field model for the benefit of clarity , our treatment is carried out in a geometrically covariant language which allows our results to easy extend to more general setups involving more than two fields or a non - trivial sigma model metric : through field redefinitions , one can always work in a basis where one transforms away the sigma model metric at the expense of introducing derivative interactions ( and corrections to the potential ) , which are easily accounted for . we have attempted to clarify the non -

gauss ( lg ) lattices. by exciting two pairs of lg beams with frequencies separated by a few mhz, we demonstrate the rotational generation of dark lattices with an intensity pattern rotating at an angular frequency of one or two @xmath0s of mhz. furthermore, by subjecting cold atoms to the dark or bright lattice, they can be trapped in the resulting light potential. in order to show the experimental feasibility of the scheme, we consider a setup combining an optical lattice with a quadrupole magnetic trap. interactions between light waves in a lattice are important for many areas of physics, including condensed matter physics, atomic physics and cosmology. the interaction between a light beam and an atomic lattice has fundamental and practical importance, in particular in the development of spintronic devices and optomechanics. the behaviour of light in lattices of different intensities has been investigated extensively @xcite and various theoretical models have been developed. by creating a diffraction dominated lg beam and passing light through a two - level dipole potential, it is possible to generate a bright lg lattice and a dark lattice simultaneously. this is possible not only for individual atoms, but also for large ensembles of light and dark particles, leading to the possibility of a hybrid lattice structure. a particularly interesting case is that of ultracold atoms, which can be confined in a ring lattice by an appropriate laser potential and then recombine to form a bright elliptical lattice. in this case the phase difference between the two light beams is practically zero and the intensity pattern can be rotationally propagating through the lattice at a rate that is comparable to the spin of a few 1000 particles a year. more recently, vortices have been proposed as an alternative alternative to lattices and have been demonstrated experimentally with atoms in a double - well dipole trap @xcit. the use of lattices has been suggested to play a major role in future cooling of atoms, and it has been shown that diffraction - controlled heating of an atomic crystal can also be employed for the creation of optical lattices @xcited. a further route to a quantum lattice is to to create an entanglement between two opposite light beams, which then rub against each other at the potential. for the latter case, the phase of the incident light beam is determined by the intensity gradient of the first order laser beam, and the",0.19441340782122904,"laguerre -

year @xmath0-band sky coverage covered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ). we derived distinction criteria for n and g - type bl lacs from among the 937 sources already catalogued in the 2fgl dataset, to identify their physical properties and environments. in addition to the known l and g classes, we defined three subsamples of sources detected in the near infrared, including sources in the x - ray band, which allows to evaluate the relative power of the nuclear emission to host galaxy. the general accepted assumption that a bl lac is an active nucleus of a galaxy is reviewed, along with other commonly used criteria, and it is shown that the frequency range where the emission is dominated by non - thermal processes and boosted by relativistic motions is not always considered a good tool for properly classifying this type of agns. in particular, an accurate measurement of the ca h&k spectral break contrast is not available in the literature and data are often confused with an estimate of the dilution of the break. as a consequence, rather large numbers of sources are found to have an unresolved emission from a nuclear nucleus, that can not be explained by a simple power law. the large majority of sources in our sample are of h - type as apparent from the large bump between 1 and 10. however, the fraction of l sources is rather small, despite being the largest, due to the fact that they are located in clusters or groups of galaxies. several caveats are identified in the existing surveys, including the very small flux limit of the sdss at about 4000 4000 and the possibility of contamination of some sources by emission from nearby emission or from faint radio sources. these uncertainties and the nature of some rather vague emission lines are discussed. an extensive comparison of the bl lac population with that of other active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is also presented. bl lacertae objects : general galaxies : active galaxies : emission line, galaxies : seyfert x -

thermal processes and boosted by relativistic motions , it is important to know if the nucleus is or not bright enough to overcome the host galaxy contribution , at least in frequency ranges where the latter is typically low , in particular , at frequencies higher than the ca h&k break . in fact , the contrast is based on measures of the source flux in rather small wavelength intervals on the two sides of the break , and does not takes properly into account if the nuclear emission turns out or not to be the dominant one for increasing frequencies . under this respect , the 77 g - type bl lac objects reported in table 1 were discovered in many surveys , confirming that these rather broad selection criteria are largely adopted and that the possibility of considering galaxies without a clear evidence of relativistic beaming as genuine bl lac objects is not negligible . the presence of a faint radio emission could be due to an origin different from a beamed relativistic jet and , therefore , can not be considered a definitive test . several other types of agns , e.g. radio galaxies , seyfert galaxies , etc ... are radio emitting with a large spread of power , but they do not exhibit blazar properties . as for concerning multifrequency studies , our analysis demonstrates that the detection of an x - ray flux from the direction of the candidate blazar can be confusing if the source environment is unknown . values beyond these limits do not exclude the blazar nature of the object , but they must be considered as a clear indication that further investigations are necessary . we expect , therefore , that the use of mid -

described as ` pusher ' or ` puller ' stresslets @xcite , corresponding to the case of flagella behind or in front of the cell body . these fluid flows affect passive tracers @xcite as well as swimmers : their motion is subject to convection and shear reorientation induced by neighboring organisms , which can lead to complex collective organization . macroscopic fluid flows emerge from the collective motion of a colony of motile bacteria and the suspension can exhibit a quasi - turbulent dynamics @xcite . microorganisms like _ b. subtilis _ live in porous environments , such as soil , where contact with surfaces is inevitable as mesoscale obstacles and confinement are the norm . recent experiments give insight into the interactions of single microorganisms with surfaces @xcite , yet suspension dynamics in confinement has only begun to be investigated @xcite and the role of the collectively - generated fluid flows in the macroscopic organization has yet to be fully understood . recently , wioland _ et al . _ @xcite showed that a dense suspension of _ b. subtilis _ , confined into a flattened drop , can self - organize into a spiral vortex , in which a boundary layer of cells at the drop edge moves in the opposite direction to the bulk circulation . this spatio - temporal organization is driven by the presence of the circular boundary and the interactions of bacteria with it . at the interface the packed cells move at an angle to the tangential that is dictated by the drop curvature , swimmer size and shape . this macroscopic nonequilibrium pattern and double - circulation were not anticipated by theory and have not been seen in any simulations of discrete particle systems . this is due to the computational difficulty of capturing both confinement and complex interactions between elongated swimmers . although previous simulations have demonstrated the importance of hydrodynamics in populations of spherical squirmers @xcite and rod - shaped swimmers @xcite , they do not consider boundary effects and the elongated shape of the swimmers in the steric interactions . on the other hand , continuum models of motile suspensions that include fluid dynamics , and have been successful in explaining large - scale patterns @xcite , have either ignored confinement or interactions with surfaces , or , if addressing confinement @xcite , have imposed boundary conditions that generally do not resolve the orientations of the bacteria at the interface . thus , the conditions at boundaries and microscopic interactions between cells warrant careful consideration in the modelling of these suspensions so that the macroscopic dynamics and organization are correctly captured . here , we elucidate the origin and nature of the spontaneous emergence of the spiral vortex and cellular organization in a confined motile suspension . a computational model is described for bacterial suspensions in which the direct and hydrodynamic interactions between the swimmers and the confining circular interface can be tuned . the cells are represented as oriented circles or ellipses subject to cell - cell and cell - fluid interaction , while the fluid flow is the total of the pusher dipolar fluid flows produced by each swimmer s locomotion . it is shown that while some circulation under conditions of confinement may arise with direct interactions only , hydrodynamics are necessary and crucial to reproduce and explain the double circulation that is observed experimentally . simulations ( fig . 1a - c ) are able to reproduce the emergence of the spiral vortex from an isotropic state ( fig . 1d - f ) , and give insights into the origin of the microscopic organisation of the bacteria in the drop . the computational results show the remarkable feature that cells in the bulk of the drop swim _ against _ the stronger colony - generated fluid flow and thus have a net _ backward _ motion . we confirm this observation by measuring the orientation of the cells and of their flagella through suitable fluorescent labelling methods .","the swimming and advection of swimmers by ambient fluid are central to the evolution of eukaryotic cells. despite their importance, models and simulations have never been capable of reproducing the large - scale organization and double - circulation that are observed in experimentally confined suspensions of bacteria. in this paper, we describe a minimal model and simulation method for micro - swimmer suspensions that includes direct cell - cell, cell - fluid and swimmer - generated fluid flows. in the absence of hydrodynamics, the swimmer motion is directly coupled to the fluid dynamics. in periodic domains, however, the long - range hydrodynamic interactions are crucial to reproduce the swarming state and dynamical behavior that is observed in experiments. these simulations show that under circular confinement, although swimmers swim in the same direction as the fluid, the cell alignment depends on the direction of motion of the swimmers. swimmers in a disk - shaped position are shown to push fluid backwards in response to the pressure exerted by the nearby swimmer. the magnitude of this pressure - induced motion is comparable to that predicted by active matter theories. in addition, a swimmer locomotion has been found to have spiral order in drops with diameter @xmath0. while these results are in qualitative agreement with experiments, they disagree with the predictions of simple active matter models, suggesting that additional processes are needed to explain the experiments. while swimming is the fundamental activity of most bacteria, it has been observed that in a very small class of bacteria the swimming motion is dominated by the advective fluid flow associated with the swimming of the flagella @xcite. in a simple model for self - guiding swimmers, the motion is self - propelled by steric forces generated by the fluid flow they create. taken together, these theoretical models may explain the organization and spatial order of bacterial suspensions, in particular the formation of spiral vortices, in fig. 1a.

cond-mat0507350,"here we report a study of vortex states in a thin superconducting film with a magnetic dot grown upon it by means of a method based on london - maxwell equations . vortices with single quantum flux ( @xmath0 ) , giant vortices ( vortices with multiple flux ) as well as antivortices ( vortices with negative vorticity ) are taken into consideration . it turns out that giant vortices occur , when the dot s size is sufficiently smaller ( @xmath1 ) than the effective penetration depth @xmath2 . in the case of a dot with sufficiently large size ( @xmath3 ) , the vortices with single quantum flux dominate the vortex states . their geometrical patterns are predicted up to seven vortices . our calculations do not show the spontaneous appearance of antivortices . pacs number(s ) : 74.25.dw , 74.25.ha , 74.25.qt , 74.78.-w 2 type ii superconductors are used in a wide variety of technological applications due to their high critical currents and fields @xcite . in these superconductors , vortices appear when the magnetic field exceeds the first critical field @xmath4 . under external current or field , vortices move , which causes the superconductor to switch to a resistive state . as a result , the system loses its superconductivity . because of this , vortex pinning is quite important in applications of type ii superconductors . one of the ways to pin vortices is to use the magnetic subsytems with either out - of - plane or in - plane magnetization . these subsystems are capable of trapping both vortices and antivortices , depending on the orientation and strength of their magnetization . the aforementioned systems are not only important for technological applications , such as devices that can be tuned by weak magnetic fields , but also offer rich physical effects which are not observed in the individual parts . some of these effects were predicted elsewhere @xcite . in the recent decade , magnetic dots growing on top of sc films have been extensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in experimental studies , magnetic dots with in - plane magnetization are fabricated from co , ni , fe , gd - co and sm - co alloys , whereas , for the dots with magnetization perpendicular to the plane , co / pt multilayers are used @xcite . these studies report commensurability effects on transport properties , which comfirm that the dots create and pin vortices . on theoretical side , several realizations of the aforementioned systems are analyzed through the landau - gizburg framework and london theory . in these works , the authors investigated the conditions for vortices to appear and calculated their geometric configurations in equilibrium . recently , priour _ et al . _ studied the vortex states of a sc film with a magnetic dot array grown upon on it , through ginzburg - landau theory , and found several different configurations of vortices in the sc film @xcite . similar study was also done by peeters _ et al . _ , but in the presence of a single dot @xcite . one of the interesting results that is reported by these works is , when the dot s size is on the order of a few coherence lengths @xmath5 , vortices with multiple flux quanta ( the giant vortices ) appear . the giant vortices are previously studied in the landau - ginzburg framework @xcite . the stable antivortex ( av ) ( vortices with vorticity opposite to vorticity of those trapped under the dot ) states were reported in similar systems @xcite . the most interestingly , kanda _ et . al . _ recently reported the experimental evidence of the gv states and the other rearrangements of vortices in a mesoscopic sc disc , using the multiple - tunnel - junction method @xcite . earlier , we studied the vortex states due to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) dot with out - of - plane ( perpendicular to the film ) magnetization on top of a sc thin film @xcite . in that work , we limited ourselves only to the vortices trapped under the dot , and calculated the equilibrium configurations , up to three vortices . however , in a more realistic picture , both vortices under the dot and antivortices outside the dot s boundaries can appear spontaneously , because total flux due to the magnetic dot over the entire infinite sc film is zero . actually , this problem was studied for magnetic dipoles with out - of - plane magnetization @xcite . another interesting case is giant vortex ( gv ) states with multiple unit flux @xmath6 . in usual circumstances , it is hard to get vortices with multiple flux quanta , because their energy grows as the square of their vorticity . however , this energy cost can be overcome by the dots with radii of sufficiently less than effective penetration depth @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the london penetration depth and @xmath9 is the thickness of the sc film , and with sufficiently large magnetization . in this article , we focus on the complete picture together with antivortices and giant vortices , and aim to get analytical insight for the spontaneous vortex , antivortex and giant vortex states . for this purpose , we pursue the method based on london - maxwell equations , which is fully developed elsewhere @xcite . though the london approach works well at the high @xmath10 limit , it perfectly serves our purpose and enables us to do analytical calculations . in our analytical and numerical calculations , we show that there are three regimes for the vortex states according to the dot s size . namely , when the dot s size is sufficently small , the gv states are dominant . if the dot s size is sufficently large , we see only vortex states with single quantum flux ( sqf ) . there is also an intermediate region in which both gv and sqf states appear . we calculate the geometrical configurations of sqf states in equilibrium up to seven vortices . in addition , our calculations do not show any av states . at this point , we need to remark that the london framework might seem unreliable to some readers , when the ratio of the dot s size to the coherence length , @xmath5 , is in the order of unity . however , one might expect that the vortices in the london framework , usually prefer staying in sqf states rather than gv states , since the london theory treats the vortex core as a point . our approach then underestimates the dot s size , when the gv states appear . when the vortex cores are treated more accurately , as in landau - ginzburg framework , one might expect that the dot s size would be rather larger than that we estimate in this work . nevertheless , the physics and qualitative result is still captured correctly in the london theory , although the results might be quantitatively different . in the following section , we briefly introduce the method we follow in this article . next , we study the giant vortex states with and without antivortices . the third section is devoted to a discussion on the sqf vortex states with and without av states . the last section consists of the discussions and conclusions .","we consider a thin magnetic dot, with magnetization perpendicular to its plane at @xmath0, placed upon a sc thin film. we study the properties of vortices with positive vorticity that are situated under the dot. we find that at first the vortex state appears, and with further increase of magnetization, the states turn into infinite series of such transitions. we derive the phase diagram of these states and compare them with those of the same dot without magnetization. our results suggest that the dot size is necessary for the vortex states to appear. superconducting systems offer new possibilities of superconductivity as compared with conventionalconductors. recently, superconductors have been in the spotlight again as candidates for the next generation of electronic devices. the interest in these devices is at least two - fold. first, there is the possibility of designing devices whose behavior can be easily tuned by a cosine - bose - einstein ( frbe ) effect @xcite. a second important reason is the desire to create devices where the _ edges _ of the insulating film can be directly examined and control. in contrast to the conventional fermi devices, the electronic dot can be very small to expose a small fraction of the parameter space of a superconductor. thus, it is possible to experimentally test whether whether the dot s properties are stable or not by probing the edges of the film. in this paper, we address this question by considering a small magnetic dot on a thin sc film. our aim is to study the gv states that appear when the dots are placed on the second plane of the sc film ( fig. [ schematics ] ). gvs are unstable states of the quantum fluctuation theory ( qft ) in which the flux from the dot penetrates into the film and the vortex - magnetization interaction can be switched off and on. the key idea is to create a small dot, whose magnetization does not change direction due to the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction. this idea was originally proposed by gottfried, as part of his experiments on top - spin "" states of semiconductor quantum dots ( see, e.g., ref. 691@xcite ). the dots were fabricated from co, ni, fe, gd - co and sm - co alloys. they were smaller than 2 nm and had a high magnetization relative to the non - magnetic cuprates. a dot placed on a normal sc film was also considered, and it was shown that gvs can",0.15539182853315472,"in order to attack this problem , we consider a thin circular magnetic dot of radius @xmath11 with magnetization perpendicular to its plane at @xmath12 , placed upon a thin sc film which both lay on the x - y plane @xmath13 ( see fig .

astro-ph0603746,"in previous work we have presented evidence for the existence of intrinsic magnetic moments in black hole candidates . we later developed a general relativistic , magnetospheric eternally collapsing object ( meco ) model for black hole candidates and showed that the model is consistent with broad band spectral and luminosity characteristics and accounts for the radio / x - ray luminosity correlations of both galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . since magnetic moments are forbidden attributes for black holes , the meco model has the potential to test whether black hole candidates are actual black holes . we show here that the meco model has the advantage of being able to : a ) satisfy the luminosity constraints that have been claimed as proof of an event horizon for sgr a * , b ) reconcile the low bolometric luminosity with the expected bondi accretion rate for sgr a * by means of a magnetic propeller driven outflow , c ) account for the sgr a * nir and x - ray luminosities , the general characteristics of its broad band spectrum , and the sequence of flares in different spectral ranges as well as the pattern of its observed orthogonal polarizations . we also include specific predictions for images that may be obtained in sub - millimeter to nir wavelengths in the near future . high resolution images in radio frequencies should be elongated in an equatorial outflow plane , while high resolution images in shorter infrared wavelengths should be elongated along an orthogonal , magnetic polar inflow axis ( generally n - s ) . since the emissions in these shorter wavelengths are confined to a narrow axial inflow cone , and radio frequencies are generated primarily at greater distances in the equatorial outflow , there would be no uniform background to provide a silhouette image of a dark central object . additional future tests for the presence of an intrinsic magnetic moment for sgr a * will require global solutions for electron density and magnetic field distributions in a bondi accretion flow into a compact , rotating magnetic dipole . these will provide for definitive tests in the form of detailed calculations of spectral and spatial luminosity distributions and polarization maps for direct comparison with high resolution images of sgr a*. _ key words : _ accretion , accretion disks black hole physics galaxy : center gravitation infrared : general magnetic fields","if the low bolometric luminosity of sgr a * is a sign that it possesses a magnetic moment then it must possess an intrinsic magnetic moment or a quantum moment which can significantly reduce the accretion rate. if this were the case, the radiative cooling of the accreting plasma within the magnetosphere would cause its luminosity to drop well below the eddington limit value. we show here that for a strongly magnetic equatorial flow, the quiescent x - ray luminosity would be too bright for its to be consistent with observations unless the jet outflow contains a substantial amount of non - thermal electrons. such an outflow would produce optically thick synchrotron radiation with positive spectral index at frequencies below the sound speed and would produce radio flares. however, the predicted timing of these flares is consistent with the meco model, with sub - mm flaring preceding the strongest near - infrared and soft / high @xmath0 radio flares and stronger delayed radio and optical flare emissions. the luminosity produced in the equatorial inflows would be comparable to, or even higher than, that in standard thin disk accretion models of accretion flows into a black hole, however there is no evidence that the bondi accretion flow within the schwarzschild radius would produce any strong radio flares in quiescence. we then show that there is a natural limit to the spin rate that can be produced by magnetic meco - jet outflows into low mass objects. in the absence of a magnetic propeller mechanism, the only way that this model can explain the observed low luminosity is that the magnetic moment and spin rate are intrinsically different for the two systems. we present analytic solutions for both types of systems and show that while the global distributions of the electron density and magnetic field are needed for a robust comparison of the results with observations, a reasonable middle ground can be found in which the properties of both systems are similar. psfig.tex # 1""cd # 1.#1""c7 # 1",0.18285714285714286,"nearly every object of stellar mass or greater is known to be magnetic to some degree . we show here that it is also consistent with the low luminosity of sgr a*. the meco model for disk accreting gbhc and agn accounts for the existence of their low / hard and high / soft x - ray spectral states . for this reason it is important that it be tested . because much of the spectrum of sgr a * appears to originate in synchrotron - cyclotron radiation then show that we can reconcile the observed low luminosity of sgr a * with the expected bondi accretion flow rate . for the discussion to follow and also for the convenience of readers who might wish to relate meco properties to observations of other objects , we have tabulated a number of useful relations in table 1 . a black hole riaf can be used to account for most of the spectral distribution that has been observed , provided that it would be allowed to produce some radio emission in the disk as well as the jet . we have shown that the meco model accounts for the lack of observed surface luminosity from sgr a*. although it is necessary to know the global distributions of electron density and magnetic fields before spatial and spectral energy distributions can be accurately calculated , we have shown that a spectrum of approximately the correct luminosity and spectral indexes would be produced in the inflow - outflow zones of a bondi accretion flow into the magnetic field of a meco . the axial inflow would produce steeply declining ( negative index ) optically thin nir emissions as well as some correlated x - ray ssc and brehmsstrahlung emissions that could be observed in flares caused by high density clumps in the inflow . we have shown that timing of flares in radio / nir / x - ray bands is consistent with the meco - bondi model , with some weak sub - mm flaring preceding the strongest nir and ssc x - ray flares which are then followed by stronger delayed sub - mm and radio flare emissions . the bulk of the quiescent x - ray luminosity would be thermally generated within the magnetosphere in a mixed inflow / outflow pattern of @xmath91 size . we have shown that the low bolometric luminosity of sgr a * can be reconciled with an expected bondi accretion rate in a completely natural way . the magnetic propeller mechanism is a robust , stable physical mechanism for reducing the bondi accretion rate to levels compatible with the low luminosity of sgr a*. the only parameters that have been necessary for these calculations are the ion density and sound speed at the bondi radius , mass , magnetic moment and spin . the intrinsic magnetic moment of a meco is an inherent , mass dependent feature which is generated by the effects of the quantum electrodynamic stablility conditions that are required by the einstein - maxwell equations that describe the highly red shifted eddington limited meco collapse process ( rl06 ) . its magnitude sets a natural high frequency limit for the synchrotron emissions in the axial inflow . a * described here , there are regions of differing magnetic field strength and orientation , strong density variations and both inflows and outflows . we have shown that there are places of origin in this flow for all of the spectral , spatial , polarization and timing features that have so far been observed for sgr a*. the patterns of inflow and outflow differ from those expected of black hole models and should be observable by the proposed gravity array ( eisenhauer et al .",0.19470899470899466,-0.011851851851851808

anisotropic media, non - linear materials, left - handed media and photonic crystals. one example of such materials is the uniaxial drude material. the spatial dispersion effects in this material are taken into account in the modeling using an auxiliary differential equation method which is formulated as a permittivity tensor. in contrast to the previous analytical models which only consider the frequency dispersive effects, we present analytical expressions which account for the spatial as well as the frequency dependent dispersion. we demonstrate the significant role of taking into account these effects in the modeled wire medium by modeling a planar slab of three - dimensional wire media, the lattices of which are parallel and ideally conducting, in the @xmath0-dimensional space. we consider two types of the modes which correspond to the transmission lines, the transverse magnetic field with respect to the wires and the extraordinary ( as opposed to the ordinary modes ) modes which are special kinds of waves when the wavelength in the free space is comparable with the period of the structure. in the thin wire approximation one can regard these as the modes of a sub - millimeter transmission line which does not interact with the wires, but with zero electric field along the wires. these modes are capable of transporting light across the interface of the lattice in different directions from one interface to another. we also introduce a new mode, the transmission line mode ( transmission - line ), which can be used to transmit transverse electric field with zero bias in the wires to another interface. numerical simulations of the modeled planar slabs show that as the wavelength decreases and the mode - to - mode switching occurs over a wide range of frequencies. 99 j. a. pendry, ` ` journal of biomedical optics, '' j. submillimeterwave technol. * 14 *, 033406 ( 2011 ). w. wang, l. peng, q. li, xie, r. zhang, x. jiang, f. torquato, x.- c. guo, and f. n. k. lee, solid state sub",0.12197483059051305,"the conventional imaging systems operate only with propagating harmonics emitted by a source , since the spatial harmonics carrying sub - wavelength information ( evanescent waves ) exhibit exponential decay in free space . a planar slab of such a material provides an opportunity for imaging with sub - wavelength resolution due to the effects of negative refraction and amplification of evanescent waves . there is an alternative approach for sub - wavelength imaging which does not involve either left - handed media or effects of negative refraction and amplification of evanescent waves . canalization_. the idea is that both propagating and evanescent harmonics of a source can be transformed into the propagating waves inside a slab of certain materials . then , these propagating modes are capable of transporting sub - wavelength images from one interface of the slab to another . we study the performance of sub - wavelength imaging by transmission devices formed by the wire medium at microwave frequencies . the finite - sized planar slabs of wire medium excited by sub - wavelength sources are modeled using the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method . this medium has been known as an artificial dielectric with plasma - like properties at microwave frequencies for a long time @xcite , but only recently it was shown that the wire medium has strong spatial dispersion @xcite . in other words , the wire medium is a non - local material and in the spectral domain it can not be described using only frequency dependent permittivity tensor . these modes travel with the speed of light along the wires ( @xmath13 ) and can have any wave vector in the transverse direction . effectively , these waves correspond to the modes of a multi - conductor transmission line formed by the wires , and enable us to use wire medium for realization of the canalization regime . the presence of tem ( transmission - line ) mode provides an evidence of the strong spatial dispersion in the wire media . usually , effects of the spatial dispersion can be observed in any periodical structure at the frequencies corresponding to the spatial resonances when the wavelength in the free space is comparable with the period of the structure , as in usual photonic and electromagnetic crystals , or when the wavelength in the crystal becomes comparable with the period of the structure due to the resonant behavior of inclusions , like in the case of resonant artificial dielectrics or photonic crystals made from self - resonant inclusions . the wire medium is a unique material where the spatial dispersion is observed at very low frequencies and without any resonant effects . we have implemented the spatially dispersive fdtd method in two - dimensional simulations in order to study the wave propagation through the wire medium . the spatially dispersive fdtd method has been developed for efficient modeling of the wave propagation in the wire medium using the effective medium approach .",0.16333938294010888,-0.04136455234959584

up form and the work has been partially supported by the university of edinburgh. the first published paper in the field of theoretical physics is due to g.alexander@phys.j.c.2 in 1997. he was attracted attention because of its high sensitivity to different physical phenomena, such as the heavy ion decays at low energies. in this paper we will focus on the physics that was responsible for his discovery, namely the high - resolution spectrometer ( siw ) on the vlt, with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the operation of the siw and the role of its interactions in the determination of the luminosity of the detector. we plan to make several measurements in the coming years. one of the most exciting lines of research at the present time is the measurement, with a very high experimental sensitivity, of the scaling of the physical quantities with energies. for example, the leptonic contribution to the amplitude of the electroweak coupling is directly estimated from the integrated luminosity, while the hadronic part is measured from the correlation function of observables near the resonance peak. this area of parameter space is, however, completely unexplored, so that at present a theoretical explanation is required for such a measurement. in the appendix we discuss the implications of our results from a theoretical point of view. 0.",0.08751334044823907,", such measurements currently constitute a stringent overall test of the standard model , in which many classes of radiative corrections are probed , involving electromagnetic , strong and weak interactions . direct _ measurement of the running of the electromagnetic coupling in the space -

shell systems with several local orbital and spin degrees of freedom , electronic - structure calculations remain a challenge . ground - state properties and spectral functions may be calculated by exact diagonalization of the many - electron hamiltonian , but this is hindered by the exponential growth of the hilbert - space with the number of correlated electrons in the system . exploiting symmetry and limiting the number of correlated electronic degrees of freedom may enable the treatment of relatively large clusters , as done in the important case of doped high-@xmath6 cuprates , where symmetry in the spin sector allowed lau and coworkers to use clusters with up to 32 cuo@xmath7 plackets , each with a single cu @xmath8 , and two o @xmath9 orbitals.@xcite for _ local _ properties , such as excitonic spectra , exact diagonalization for finite clusters becomes much more appealing , as relatively small clusters often suffice . magnetic anisotropies , @xmath10-tensors , magnetization -

efficient method , able to account for many of the local properties and excitonic spectra of correlated materials . mlft calculations traditionally use parameters fitted to experiments . despite being a great help for understanding and interpreting experimental results , this approach is however not completely satisfactory and , over the years , numerous theoretical studies have therefore been devoted to obtaining mlft parameters _ ab initio_.@xcite sugano and shulman @xcite calculated the ligand -

mean - field calculations for realistic solids ( lda+dmft ) . @xcite we start our _ ab initio _ mlft calculation by performing a dft calculation for the proper , infinite crystal using a modern dft code which employs an accurate density functional and basis set ( e.g. lapws).andersen75,blaha90 from the ( selfconsistent ) dft crystal potential we then calculate _ a set of wannier functions _ suitable as single - particle basis for the mlft calculation.@xcite since the members of such a set are centered either on the tm or ligand atoms , we shall call them wannier _ orbitals . _ typically , they are the tm @xmath0- and oxygen @xmath1-orbitals which , _ taken together _ , exactly describe the dft @xmath15- and @xmath16 bands . in general , the set should be minimal and span _ exactly _ all dft solutions in the energy range relevant for the property to be calculated . it is important that this set contains sufficiently many ligand orbitals to make the _ correlated _ tm _ orbitals well localized , _ _ i.e. _ the tm @xmath11-orbitals should not have tails on any other atom . this localization allows one to restrict the many - electron calculations of local properties to a single tm site plus its ligand neighbors . hence , in the current method , there are no embedding errors , except those arising from truncating the single -

electron potential from the ( fully selfconsistent ) lda basis set. because of the limited overlap of the orbital degrees of freedom with the atomic states, the lda core - level potential is not maximally localized, and therefore the essential part of the coulomb interaction has to be maximally screened. the calculated potential has been used to compare experiment and theory for several established spectroscopic features of these compounds. the comparison shows that the mlft calculations are in agreement with the experimental spectra except for the crystal - field splitting which is almost 10 % too high in nio. we show that the splittingscale for the o @xmath4 orbitals in our lda - based mlft calculation is about 10 % larger than that for the slater integrals. however, the multiplet splitting due to the screening is not important in deciding which of the two potentials will be realized in the experiment, and it is not even important for the core excitations. the inelastic x - ray scattering technique has been applied to separate the optically thin inner shell excitations from the high- and low - energy states of nio and mno. the compared spectra of these oxides show that many of the features can be captured by mlft theory, but some features are completely absent from local calculations. _ keywords _ : multiplet, multiplet, field theory, excitonic, electron, transition metal. + * pacs number(s ) : * 05.70.-a, 05.75.-y, 42.50.lc, 43.60.+c, 41.60.-r, 4110.jv + * msc * : 51.20.-m, 71.10.lq * key words : * multiblock footnote omitted * + + +",0.1276324186343331,"in this section we introduce the _ ab initio _ mlft method by the example of nio . nio is a metal , in strong contrast to experiments where nio is found to be a good insulator with a room -

particle hamiltonian composed of two bogoliubov states, the nodal region and the intermediate region. the parameters of the model are determined by a delicate competition of the three components, i.e., the excitation energy, the coupling constant and the spin -

necessarily - commutative automorphisms of a vertex operator algebra. by twisted modules we mean ( generalized or logarithmic ) twisted modules of arbitrary genus. they come from chiral vertex operators in physics and were introduced by frenkel, lepowsky and meurman @xcite. they have been studied systematically in the literature and played an important role in the representation theory of vertex operator algebras and two - dimensional conformal field theories. if the vertex operator subalgebra fixed by the automorphism group of an algebra satisfies suitable conditions ( for example, the three conditions in conjecture [ twisted - int - op ] ), then one possible choice of such a structure large enough for our purpose is the intertwining operator algebra formed by the modules and intertwined operators for the fixed - point vertex operator seeding. however, the assumption that these suitable conditions hold is in fact a main conjecture that we have to prove first. because of this, the assumptions used to derive the conjectures are often themselves the most difficult parts of the computations required to prove them. to prove a theorem or a proof of an interesting theorem, however, in order to obtain a proof, we first have to work with multivalued analytic functions with preferred branches. such functions are the kind of ones we study in this paper. we prove that for @xmath0, there exists a subtraction procedure to obtain such functions on a region of the same region, that is to say, we can take the form of decomposition functions on branches of the single - valued branch on the region and divide the functions on that branch into two separate regions, respectively. we also give a careful analysis of the relations between these two subsets of functions and vertex operators and show that the corresponding functions in the subtraction sequence do not violate the contragredient functor on the category of twisted modules. 2.0 cm * 2000 mathematics subject classification : * 60k35, 60j20, 60k25, 82c22, 34c20, 34j50, 34m05",0.15592203898050971,"intertwining operators give chiral three -

0904.4279,"equilibrium charge distribution on a thin , straight conductor has been actively discussed in recent years , starting with griffiths and li @xcite , who suspected a uniform distribution , and culminating with maxwell s insightful words @xcite as reported by jackson @xcite . the present work addresses the electrostatic problem of a thin , curved , cylindrical conductor , or a conducting _ filament _ , and shows that the corresponding linear charge density slowly tends to uniformity as the inverse of the logarithm of a characteristic parameter which is the ratio of the diameter to the smaller of the length and minimum radius of curvature of the filament . an alternative derivation of this result directly based on energy minimization is developed . these results are based on a general asymptotic analysis of the electric field components and potential near a charge filament in the limit of vanishing diameter whereby the divergent parts of these quantities are explicitly calculated . it is found that the divergent parts of the radial and azimuthal electric field components , as well as the electric potential , are determined by the local charge density while the axial component is determined by the local dipole density . for a straight filament , these results reduce to those for conducting needles discussed in the literature . for curved filaments , the configuration of charges and fields is no longer azimuthally symmetric , and there is an additional length scale in the problem arising from the finite radius of curvature of the filament . remarkably , the basic uniformity result survives the added complications , which include an azimuthal variation in the surface charge density of the filament . as with the variations of linear charge density along the filament , the azimuthal variations vanish with the characteristic parameter , only more rapidly . these uniformity results yield an asymptotic formula for the capacitance of a curved filament that generalizes maxwell s original result . the examples of a straight filament with uniform and linearly varying charge densities , as well as a circular filament with a uniform charge distribution , are treated analytically and found to be in agreement with the results of the general analysis . numerical calculations illustrating the slow convergence of linear charge distribution to uniformity for an elliptical filament are presented , and an interactive computer program implementing and animating the numerical calculations is provided .","the distribution of charge on a thin, cylindrical conductor has been the subject of much theoretical interest in recent years. the intuition underlying this inquiry is the expectation that a sufficiently thin, smoothly curved filament, when viewed up close, would appear long and straight, so that the equilibrium behavior of charges on the filament should be nearly uniform _ just as in the case of straight conductors _. here we consider the behavior of the electric field components and the electrostatic potential in the limit of vanishing distance from an arbitrary point of the filament, and carry out an asymptotic analysis to calculate the divergent parts of these quantities explicitly. we can conclude that the equipotential surfaces of the physical filament approach those of the ideal one as its diameter vanishes, and use this to deduce the inverse - logarithmic approach of charge distribution to uniformity. the primary result of this paper is that the density of charge along a regular conducting filament of fixed diameter tends to uniformidity according to eq.

1612.01201,"andreev bound states ( abss ) are well - defined many - body quantum states that emerge from the hybridization of individual quantum dot ( qd ) states with a superconductor and exhibit very rich and fundamental phenomena . we demonstrate several new electron transport phenomena mediated by abss that form on three - terminal carbon nanotube ( cnt ) qds , with one superconducting ( s ) contact in the center and two adjacent normal metal ( n ) contacts . three - terminal spectroscopy allows us to identify the coupling to the n contacts as the origin of the andreev resonance ( ar ) linewidths and to determine the critical coupling strengths to s , for which a ground state ( or quantum phase ) transition in such s - qd systems can occur . in addition , we ascribe replicas of the lowest - energy abs resonance to transitions between the abs and odd - parity excited qd states , a process we call excited state abs resonances . in the conductance between the two n contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative differential subgap conductance , which we explain by considering two nonlocal processes , the creation of cooper pairs in s by electrons from both n terminals , and a novel transport mechanism called resonant abs tunneling , possible only in multi - terminal qd devices . in the latter process , electrons are transferred via the abs without effectively creating cooper pairs in s. the three - terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy experiments with different boundary conditions , for example by leaving s floating . surprisingly , we find that , depending on the boundary conditions and the device parameters , the experiments either show single - particle coulomb blockade resonances , abs characteristics , or both in the same measurements , seemingly contradicting the notion of abss replacing the single particle states as eigenstates of the qd . we qualitatively explain these results as originating from the finite time scale required for the coherent oscillations between the superposition states after a single electron tunneling event . these experiments demonstrate that three - terminal experiments on a single complex quantum object can also be useful to investigate charge dynamics otherwise not accessible due to the very high frequencies .","we investigateabs mediated electron transport in three - terminal quantum dot devices fabricated on carbon nanotubes with one central superconducting contact. we find that the ground state of the quantum dot ( qd ) can be interpreted as a superposition of the even and doubly occupied charge states of the single qd, and that abs can be excited by single electron tunneling events whose characteristic frequency is determined by the coupling strength to the normal metal contacts ( n ), @xmath0. we show that for weak n - n coupling the abs resonances can be resolved by andreev resonances ( ars ) in the third terminal. from the measurement results we conclude that the broad absorption features we observe in some devices are caused by abs mediated transport from n to s. finally, we demonstrate that a finite coupling to s allows the exchange of even charge states, which is necessary for the hybridization of the qd with s. our results suggest that in some parameter regime both sets of states are available for different transport processes. * introduction * strong coupling to superconductors is a prerequisite for the development of new physics beyond the standard model of superconductivity.@xcite this is due to the fact that weak coupling to a superconductor results in a large gap in the electronic band structure of the system, which can be used to introduce a new ` ` anomalous '' states into the system. one of the most promising candidates for this mechanism is the long - range coupling to electronic systems, which offers the possibility to bypass the problem of the pairing phase transition and give access to the electronic phase transition at large separations and high electron densities. @xcite however, the origin of these anomalous states remains unclear. some theoretical predictions might be related to the formation of new phases or topological excitations. transport spectroscopy, however, has not been able to probe the detailed dynamics of electrons in two - terminal devices. to address this issue, here we discuss three different approaches that have been used to investigate absorption of electrons by electrons confined in two-terminal quantum dots ( qds ). the first approach is to use a weakly coupled qd to an n - qd system in which the interactions are strongly coupled to an external normal metal ( s ) point such that the two qds can be separated in energy by a short normal metal tunneling event. in this approach it is possible to gain insight into the electronic dynamics of the ultrafast ( lt ), which gives rise to characteristic peaks in",0.17819148936170212,"however , the coupling strengths can only be accessed unambiguously in three terminal geometries.@xcite here we report experiments on three - terminal qd devices fabricated on carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) with one central superconducting contact inducing abss on the qd . a scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) we investigate three devices with different coupling strengths @xmath0 to s to investigate several of these open questions and demonstrate a series of new effects and measurement configurations . [ sec : abs_basics ] we summarize our intuitive picture of abss and abs - mediated electron transport in two - terminal devices . [ sec : abs - devicecharacteriation ] , from which we extract the tunnel coupling strengths to the individual contacts and demonstrate that @xmath0 determines the system ground state and abs dispersion , while the coupling strengths to the normal metal contacts , @xmath2determine the spectroscopic width of the andreev resonances ( ars).@xcite one device shows replicas of the lowest - energy abs resonance at higher energies , which we ascribe to transitions to excited odd - parity qd states in sec . [ sec : abs - serialtransport ] , we analyze the transport between the two normal metal contacts mediated by abss , in which competing local and nonlocal transport mechanisms give rise to a characteristic pattern of positive and negative differential conductance . for illustration and to establish some terms used below , we consider a qd with a single , spin - degenerate level strongly tunnel coupled to a superconductor and weakly to a normal contact . the former couples even charge states of the isolated qd by exchanging cooper pairs to form new eigenstates of the s - qd system . in the limit of a large superconducting energy gap , @xmath3 ( superconducting atomic limit ) , the emerging abs can be written as a superposition of the even ( empty and doubly occupied ) charge states of the isolated qd , i.e. , as a singlet eigenstate @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the gate - dependent bogoliubov- de gennes ( bdg ) amplitudes and @xmath7 the corresponding eigenenergy . we have fabricated cnt three - terminal devices with a lead ( pb ) based central @xmath46 nm wide pd / pb / in ( @xmath47 nm ) s contact,@xcite two pd n contacts and two sidegates ( sgs ) using close to residue free electron beam lithography.@xcite the typical critical perpendicular field for these s contacts is @xmath46mt and we apply @xmath48mt for our normal state experiments . if this happens faster than half a coherent oscillation , the tunneling electron stays in the bare qd state during the time it resides on the cnt segment . assuming that an oscillation by half a period is required to transfer a cooper pair to s , we find the relation @xmath257 as a necessary condition to observe the bare qd resonances , in good agreement with device a , but not for the other two devices with considerably larger @xmath0 and a faster oscillation rate relative to @xmath258 . our results demonstrate that a three - terminal qd can give access to the fast electron dynamics , in our example of the abs coherent oscillations with frequencies @xmath259 in the range between @xmath260ghz ( device a ) to @xmath261ghz ( device b ) , by the implicit comparison of the tunnel rates to the third terminal . in summary , we investigate electronic transport mediated by andreev bound states in a three - terminal s - qd device and identify the coupling to the normal metal leads as the main source for the spectroscopic broadening of the andreev resonances , and establish how the coupling to the superconductor determines the ground state of the system . in addition , we present ` excited state andreev resonances ' at higher energies , with transitions between abss and odd parity excited qd states . surprisingly , we find that depending on the imposed boundary conditions in the experiments it is possible to observe either abss or coulomb blockade resonances , or both in the same experiment , which we tentatively attribute to the competition between coherent oscillations in the abs ( exchange of cooper pairs with s ) and the relaxation of the system by single electron tunneling into the second normal terminal . we believe that experiments on complex quantum systems using multiple terminals provide a novel and clear experimental probe for many old and new phenomena , here for example the onset of the superconducting proximity effect on a qd and the formation of many - body quantum states . in this appendix we analyze additional data of devices a , b and c. in particular , we discuss the electronic configuration of each device , using conductance maps as a function of both sidegate voltages .",0.21677662582469368,-0.038585136462991554
q-bio0610054,"using computational modelling , we investigate mechanisms of signal transduction focusing on the spindle assembly checkpoint where a single unattached kinetochore is able to signal to prevent cell cycle progression . this inhibitory signal switches off rapidly once spindle microtubules have attached to all kinetochores . this requirement tightly constrains the possible mechanisms . here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint operation in metazoan cells , both supported by recent experiments . the first involves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell - cycle regulators . this mechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery data and also by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in metazoan cells . using a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation , we find that this mechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a two stage signal amplification cascade . the second mechanism involves spatial gradients of a short - lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion but then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules . we propose that both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly checkpoint , with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support from the other pathway . keywords : signal transduction , kinetochore , spindle assembly checkpoint , mathematical modelling the question of how a signal emanating from a small , compact structure in a cell can be amplified and propagated to an entire cell is fundamental to cell biology @xcite . an excellent example is provided by the spindle assembly checkpoint ( sac ) @xcite , which regulates cell cycle progression from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis . the segregation of sister chromatids that occurs during anaphase is permitted only after all the kinetochores are attached via microtubules to the mitotic spindle . even a single unattached kinetochore can signal to the rest of the cell and prevent cell cycle progression @xcite . a fundamental issue is how a relatively small structure , such as a kinetochore , can generate sufficient signal to robustly communicate with distant subcellular locations @xcite . moreover , this signal must switch off rapidly , within a period of minutes , after complete kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubules @xcite . these requirements strongly constrain the possible signal transduction mechanisms . in this paper , we focus particularly on the sac in cases where the nuclear envelope breaks down prior to sac activity ( open mitosis ) , as in metazoan cells . in this context , we examine two distinct models : a diffusive sequestration model and a model involving active signal transport along spindle microtubules . we believe that both of these pathways may be in simultaneous operation in the metazoan sac . the metaphase / anaphase transition is triggered by an intricate sequence of events centred around the proteins securin , cyclin b and separase . the first step is the ubiquitination of securin and cyclin b by the anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome ( apc / c ) @xcite , a process that tags securin / cyclin b for destruction via the 26s proteasome . this degradation allows separase to cleave the cohesin complex that tethers sister chromatids together . once the cohesin complex has been cleaved , the sister chromatids aree pulled apart to opposite poles by the mitotic spindle . in order to prevent premature entry into anaphase , the sac must prevent securin / cyclin b ubiquitination by the apc / c until proper attachment of _ all _ chromosomes to the spindle . evidence has accumulated for a number of overlapping , and therefore possibly redundant , mechanisms for sac operation . the apc / c is known to be stimulated by cdc20 binding ; hence , a plausible way to achieve apc / c inhibition is to inhibit the ability of cdc20 to bind to the apc / c . one possibility is that cdc20 is held , sequestered , in an inactive form via binding to mad2 , with the production of cdc20-mad2 being promoted by unattached kinetochores @xcite . key proteins identified at unattached kinetochores include bub1 , mad1 , mad2 , bubr1 ( mad3 in budding yeast ) , bub3 and cdc20 . moreover , frap experiments have revealed that some of these proteins , including mad2 , bubr1 and cdc20 , turnover rapidly at unattached kinetochores @xcite . furthermore , the available evidence suggests that mad2 exists in two forms : open ( o - mad2 ) and closed ( c - mad2 ) @xcite , with the closed form adopted when bound to cdc20 . production of c - mad2-cdc20 may be catalysed via the kinetochore bound c - mad2-mad1 complex . intriguingly , refs . @xcite propose that c - mad2-cdc20 away from the unattached kinetochore can convert further cytosolic o - mad2 and cdc20 into their bound c - mad2-cdc20 state . in this way the relatively weak signal coming from an unattached kinetochore can be amplified leading to comprehensive cdc20 sequestration throughout the cell . recent experiments have further implicated a protein called p31@xmath0 in switching off this signal after complete kinetochore attachment @xcite . however , the above ` ` mad template '' model is not the only proposed mechanism for apc / c repression . bubr1 and bub3 are also known to bind cdc20 and thus repress the apc / c @xcite . indeed , bubr1 appears to be a more potent inhibitor of cdc20 than mad2 , and both bubr1 and mad2 may mutually promote each other s binding to cdc20 @xcite . furthermore , bub1 is believed to phosphorylate cdc20 , possibly also repressing the apc / c @xcite . in addition , the overall copy number of cdc20 is down - regulated until all the kinetochores are attached @xcite . clearly , reducing the overall number of cdc20 will impair the effectiveness of the apc / c prior to anaphase . moreover , not only does cdc20 form complexes with mad2 and bubr1 , but it is also believed to form a separate complex called the mitotic checkpoint complex ( mcc ) , consisting of mad2 , bubr1 , bub3 and cdc20 @xcite . this complex also appears to be a potent inhibitor of the apc / c @xcite . in addition , the apc / c is regulated by phosphorylation through the kinase cdk1 @xcite . lastly , the apc / c itself has intriguing localization properties , localizing , for example , to unattached kinetochores @xcite . this positioning may also have implications for the mechanism of apc / c inhibition . recently , a pioneering paper by doncic _ et al . _ @xcite introduced a careful mathematical analysis to the question of how the sac functions . focusing on yeast , they analysed various simplified models of how an unattached kinetochore can signal to the rest of the cell . yeast undergoes closed mitosis , where even at the onset of anaphase the nuclear envelope is still complete . as a consequence , a diffusive signal from an unattached kinetochore is only required to propagate within the nuclear volume of a few cubic microns . however , one important difference between yeast and metazoan cells is that the latter undergo open mitosis , where the nuclear envelope has broken down by the time the sac is active ; hence any freely diffusing signal from an unattached kinetochore must propagate throughout the cytoplasm , a volume a thousand times larger than the nucleus of a yeast cell . furthermore a considerable amount of data is available concerning the metazoan sac in the form of flourescent bleaching data and estimates for the copy numbers of the relevant molecules . in this paper , we therefore use computational modelling to analyze the sac in metazoan cells . we develop a new model that incorporates two step signal amplification , a mechanism with close similarities to previously investigated multistep signal cascades @xcite . this similarity points towards a close connection between the sac and other cell signalling systems , such as mapk cascades . importantly , we find that our model generates robust inhibition in metazoan cells , unlike models without an amplification step . as discussed above , the most popular models of apc / c inhibition involve transport solely by diffusion . however , these models are hard to reconcile with experiments of rieder _ et al . _ @xcite . using cells with two independent spindles , rieder _ et al . _ found that unattached kinetochores on one spindle did not block anaphase onset in a neighbouring complete spindle . this experiment appears to indicate that any ` ` wait anaphase '' signal would have to be limited to a single spindle , and _ not _ diffuse throughout the cytosol . this finding is in clear contradiction with the mechanisms introduced above . for this reason we develop a second model where a short - lived signal from an unattached kinetochore first diffuses to a nearby microtubule , before being actively transported along spindle microtubules . in this way the signal is restricted to the spindle . moreover , we propose that both the active transport and diffusive mechanisms may be in simultaneous use in metazoan cells . we suggest that either of the signalling mechanisms may individually be able to initiate anaphase , even without support from the other pathway . with this assumption , our models are then fully consistent with both the experiments of rieder _ et al . _ @xcite and with a diffusive sequestration model @xcite .","in metazoans, the concentration of a freely diffusing species, @xmath0, is known to be a key determinant of whether a cell will be inhibitory or signaling. in the simplest model of signaling, the inhibory species is produced at a kinetochore and then diffuses in the cytoplasm, but only until it either encounters a minus - end directed microtubule - bound molecular motor, or decays to an inactive form. since both mad2 and bubr1 are known to bind to cdc20, we can tentatively identify the inhibiting species with this complex. based on this model we propose two possible mechanisms of signaling in metazoan cells. the first is a mechanism in which a ` ` go anaphase '' signal is transmitted from the spindle pole by molecular motors. if such a motor were linked to the mad2 binding site then inhibition of the inhibitory signal would essentially shut off the active transport. however, data from frap ( fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ) experiments on the state - of - the - art model of the metazoan sac show that fluxes on the disk are sufficient to maintain inhibition. therefore, we find that both mechanisms are possible to explain the experimental data. the second mechanism is based on an active transport mechanism. in this model, an extra process is added to the pathway by a diffusive amplification step. we predict that if this model is correct, then cell anaphases should be triggered by an external signal. indeed, we show from our model that the time for this signal to diffuse across the cell is much shorter than the timescale for reactions within the cell. thus, our model with an amplification step is able to explain some of the observed features of the sac. these findings are qualitatively consistent with models where inhibition propagates purely diffusively away from incomplete kinetched kinetchores, or in other words, where the cell spindle plays an active role. * how genes are regulated by chemical signaling is a key issue in biology. if a chemical agent is responsible for a chemical reaction then it is critical to determine the effects that the associated molecule is doing. for example, the power to drive dna synthesis in yeast is needed to counter the effect of dna damage @xcite. similarly, the importance of the ability to detect and respond to changes in environment, for example due to the effects of humidity, is required to determine if a drug that targets cells with a negative target is effective",0.1316371681415929,"we analyze the case where the kinetochores control the concentration of a freely diffusing species @xmath1 . when a kinetochore is unattached and so is signalling , a large majority of the species @xmath1 is in the @xmath2 state , but when the last kinetochore itself switches off , the @xmath2 species rapidly decays to the @xmath1 state , thus communicating the switch - off ( attachment ) to the rest of the cell . @xmath5 is the diffusion constant for the protein ; @xmath6 is the distance across the cell ( typically a few tens of microns ) ; and @xmath7 m @xcite is the radius of the kinetochore . , we now address the question of whether the flux of @xmath2 produced _ only _ at a single unattached kinetochore is sufficient to maintain inhibition . at steady state thus we predict that if the mechanism of the sac is diffusive amplified sequestration then measurements of the reaction rates will reveal rather fast reactions , or possibly more than two steps to the amplification process . for completeness we also analyze an alternative two species model previously proposed by doncic et al @xcite , for the smaller volumes involved in the yeast sac . the reaction scheme for their model the active transport model nevertheless predicts that the inhibitory signal is propagated away to the spindle pole by a minus - end directed motor . in this paper , we have shown that two models with quite different mechanisms : the diffusive reaction cascade model , and a model with active transport , are both possible signalling mechanisms for the sac . @xcite show that an inhibitory diffusive pathway can be overruled by a second pathway , which , as we have seen , is likely based on active transport . we therefore propose that _ either _ mechanism can trigger anaphase onset , even without support from the other pathway . future work * although some of the key principles used by the metazoan sac are starting to become clear , there is still much that remains to be understood . even for models of signalling via diffusion , which have been more actively pursued , further quantitative measurements would be very useful . also , we predict that amplification without autocatalysis is likely to be required , which implies the existence of at least two inhibiting species ( @xmath105 ) . of course , the _ in vivo _ checkpoint dynamics will likely be much more complicated than our simple outline model , but the requirement for amplification will likely remain . better characterization of the bubr1/mad1/mad2/cdc20 protein dynamics should therefore allow these predictions to be tested . we would also like to emphasize the close connection between our diffusive two step reaction and other signal cascades , such as for mapk . as we have discussed previously , it is also important to examine how any such signal is processed by the spindle pole to provide inhibition . in general , future experimental work will need to measure more of the model parameters before we can make reliable quantitative predictions for intracellular signalling .",0.13859275053304904,-0.006955582391456133
0707.2766,"helicases are molecular motors that unwind double - stranded nucleic acids ( dsna ) , such as dna and rna ) . typically a helicase translocates along one of the na single strands while unwinding and uses adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) hydrolysis as an energy source . here we model of a helicase motor that can switch between two states , which could represent two different points in the atp hydrolysis cycle . our model is an extension of the earlier betterton - jlicher model of helicases to incorporate switching between two states . the main predictions of the model are the speed of unwinding of the dsna and fluctuations around the average unwinding velocity . motivated by a recent claim that the ns3 helicase of hepatitis c virus follows a flashing ratchet mechanism , we have compared the experimental results for the ns3 helicase with a special limit of our model which corresponds to the flashing ratchet scenario . our model accounts for one key feature of the experimental data on ns3 helicase . however , contradictory observations in experiments carried out under different conditions limit the ability to compare the model to experiments . helicases are enzymes that unwind double - stranded nucleic acids ( dsna ) @xcite . helicase proteins typically translocate along one of the single strands and perform mechanical work while consuming chemical energy ( usually supplied by the hydrolysis of atp ) . therefore , these na translocases are molecular motors @xcite which share common features with cytoskeletal molecular motors @xcite . all helicases undergo a biochemical cycle which typically involves atp binding , atp hydrolysis , and release of the hydrolysis products adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) and and inorganic phosphate ( p@xmath0 ) . an important question in the study of helicase mechanisms is to understand how the atp hydrolysis cycle is coupled to the binding state and the motion of the helicase @xcite . helicases may exhibit changes in helicase / na binding affinity when the helicase is bound to atp , adp / p@xmath0 , or neither ; coordination of hydrolysis between different helicase subunits , and conformational changes in the helicase triggered by different steps in the hydrolysis cycle . some helicases form hexamers ( which include six atpase domains ) , while others are members of the non - hexameric ( dimeric or monomeric ) group ; different types of mechanochemical cycle have been suggested for the different structural classes @xcite . in all cases , one seeks to explain how the helicase coordinates na binding and hydrolysis to move along single - stranded na and unwind double - stranded na . here we develop a generic model of a helicase that switches between two biochemical states while translocating on ssna . this is a simplified representation of the different states of the helicase during the atp hydrolysis cycle . the model may be generally applicable to helicases for which the transition between two states is the key feature of the motion . in other words , this model should be a good approximation for helicases with more than two biochemical states if one transition is far slower than the others . we incorporate such a two - state picture by extending the original betterton - jlicher ( bj ) model @xcite of na helicases @xcite . our work is also connected to two - state models that have been used extensively for a variety of molecular motors @xcite . under a mean - field approximation , such models can be easily solved when periodic boundary conditions are imposed . however , the problem is usually more difficult with open boundary conditions . the model for helicase motion is even more complex because the position of one boundary ( i.e. , the ssna - dsna junction ) varies randomly with time . thus our work is also an extension of previous work on two - state models to the more difficult case of a fluctuating boundary . the two - state model developed here is consistent with the observation that binding and hydrolysis of atp can modulate the affinity of a helicase for the nucleic - acid track @xcite . the flashing - ratchet mechanism suggested qualitatively for the hepatitis c virus non - structural protein 3 ( hcv ns3 ) helicase @xcite can be captured by a special case of the generic model proposed here . in the flashing - ratchet @xcite picture , the motor protein switches between two states : one where the protein is tightly bound to the track , and another where the motor is weakly bound and can diffuse along the track . in this paper we make quantitative comparisons between our theoretical predictions for a passive helicase which follows the flashing - ratchet mechanism , and the experimental data for ns3 helicase . in section [ sec : model ] we describe the ingredients of the model : the helicase , which can switch between two states and translocate on ssna , and the fluctuating na ss - ds junction . in section [ sec : sseqns ] we calculate the single - strand translocation rate of the helicase . section [ sec : eqns ] contains the model equations for double - strand unwinding , the transformation of the equations using midpoint and difference variables , and the general solutions for the velocity and diffusion coefficient . we describe the results for a hard - wall interaction between the helicase and junction in section [ sec : soln ] . using rate constants estimated from experiments on ns3 helicase , in section [ sec : results ] we specialize to the flashing - ratchet scenario and make predictions specific to ns3 . in section [ sec : disc ] we summarize our results .","we develop a general model for unwinding of a double - stranded nucleic acid molecule by a helicase motor. the helicase can be either in biochemical state 1 or 2. the allowed transitions between states and the corresponding reaction rates can be fully described by the master equation approach. a specific helicase, ns3 helicase of hepatitis c, is our focus. we derive an analytical expression for the unwinding velocity, which is essentially the hard - wall interaction potential in the bj model. this expression is then used to compare several key features of the experimental data of ns3 with the theoretical predictions. we first consider a special case which captures the flashing ratchet mechanism proposed for ns3. we calculate the total unwinding probability by summing the reaction rates of helicase and dsna. we then consider the restricted case where only the chemical state and the base - pair binding free energy can be changed by applied force. in this case, we find that the average speed of unwinding is relatively high, @xmath0, which may be because of the small energy cost of opening the na. we critically discuss the contradictory contradictory experimental results in the literature. there are several situations in which two experimental data are contradictory. there is one situation where a specific experimental data is contradictory to a whole lot of data, yet the rest of the literature treats the data as consistent. therefore, we take a break and study a few of the details of the experiments as well as the generic aspects of the model. we conclude that the different experimental results may be due to different interpretations of the particular data, which also may be reflected in the underlying theory.",0.1663716814159292,"in this work we analyze passive unwinding , which is equivalent to a hard -

density model ( @xik0 model ). we find that the two models can produce a similar schmidt - kennicutt relation in the phase diagram, if the threshold density is chosen according to the local star formation rate ( sfr ) and the total mass in dense gas clumps is allowed to evolve from the ism to the stellar disks. the difference between the models comes from the fact that the high - density region converts into stars and supernova feedback blows out the surrounding dense gas in runs c and d. in the latter case, the gas from the reservoir to the star forming regions first has a log - normal like probability density distribution ( pdf ), while the low - density tail of the pdf has a power - law like form in a self - gravity dominated system. the complexness of the gas disks is almost the same to a similar degree. we argue that the evolution timescale in the multiphase ism is essentially independent of the star formation efficiency parameter, which is indicated by the well - known jeans condition. for the both models, the vertical scale of star particles is found to be comparable to the observed one. thus our results imply that the global sfhs and the relation of surface gas density to surface sfr are not changed by the choice of the threshold value for star formation. we also investigate the evolution of the mass of live halo particles ( e.g., nfw and oh galaxies ). it is found that a very high mass resolution is required to resolve the gaseous phase diagram. on the other hand, a moderate resolution is sufficient to generate ` ` stars '' in the halo. the stars are created either by heating of the dense gas due to sn feedback or by star formation feedback. we discuss the implications of our results for the assembly of live dark matter halos.",0.231311706629055,"therefore , their results appear to imply that the global star formation properties are not sensitive to the details of star formation prescriptions . in this paper , we examine how numerical prescriptions of star formation affect structure of the ism , and the global star formation history ( sfh ) of a galactic disk . in particular , we focus on the threshold density in star formation criteria ( @xmath5 ) and the star formation efficiency ( @xmath18 ) . we also test the effect of star formation efficiency parameter @xmath1 in high-@xmath5 models . we perform high -

nucleus interaction the average number of hadrons produced by each of the above particles is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the total hadron production. the decrease of the hadron multiplicity due to the growth of the diffusive parton spectrum, relative to the total one, can not reproduce the experimental data. the same result is obtained with the current data on pp / nucleus and pp -

1702.03948,"this article investigates the problem of enforcing a virtual holonomic constraint ( vhc ) on an underactuated mechanical system while simultaneously stabilizing a closed orbit on the constraint manifold . this problem , which to date is open , arises when designing controllers to induce complex repetitive motions in robots . in this paper , we propose a solution which relies on the parameterization of the vhcby the output of a double integrator . while the original controls are used to enforce the vhc , the control input of the double - integrator is designed to asymptotically stabilize the closed orbit and make the state of the double - integrator converge to zero . the proposed design is applied to the problem of making a pvtol aircraft follow a circle on the vertical plane with a desired speed profile , while guaranteeing that the aircraft does not roll over . virtual holonomic constraints ( vhcs ) have been recognized to be key to solving complex motion control problems in robotics . there is an increasing body of evidence from bipedal robotics @xcite , snake robot locomotion @xcite , and repetitive motion planning @xcite that vhcsconstitute a new motion control paradigm , an alternative to the traditional reference tracking framework . the key difference with the standard motion control paradigm of robotics is that , in the vhcframework , the desired motion is parameterized by the states of the mechanical system , rather than by time . grizzle and collaborators ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that the enforcement of certain vhcson a biped robot leads , under certain conditions , to the orbital stabilization of a hybrid closed orbit corresponding to a repetitive walking gait . the orbit in question lies on the constraint manifold , and the mechanism stabilizing it is the dissipation of energy that occurs when a foot impacts the ground . in a mechanical system without impacts , this stabilization mechanism disappears , and the enforcement of the vhcalone is insufficient to achieve the ultimate objective of stabilizing a repetitive behavior . some researchers @xcite have addressed this problem by using the vhcexclusively for motion planning , i.e. , to find a desired closed orbit . once a suitable closed orbit is found , a time - varying controller is designed by linearizing the control system along the orbit . in this approach , the constraint manifold is not an invariant set for the closed - loop system , and thus the vhcis not enforced via feedback . to the best of our knowledge , for mechanical control systems with degree of underactuation one , the problem of simultaneous enforcement of a vhcand orbital stabilization of a closed orbit lying on the constraint manifold is still open . * contributions of the paper . * this paper presents the first solution of the simultaneous stabilization problem just described . leveraging recent results in @xcite , we consider vhcsthat induce lagrangian constrained dynamics . the closed orbits on the constraint manifold are level sets of a ` ` virtual '' energy function . we make the vhcdynamic by parametrizing it by the output of a double - integrator . we use the original controls of the mechanical system to enforce the dynamic vhc , while we use the double - integrator input to asymptotically stabilize the selected orbit . because the output of the double - integrator acts as a perturbation of the original constraint manifold , we also make sure that the state of the double - integrator converges to zero . to achieve these objectives , we develop a novel theoretical result giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential stabilizability of a closed orbit for a control - affine system . the benefit of simultaneously enforcing a vhcand stabilizing a closed orbit is that it offers a superior control over the transient behavior of the system . this is illustrated in an example at the end of the paper , in which a pvtol vehicle performs a repetitive maneuver while guaranteeing that it does not undergo full revolutions along its longitudinal axis . * relevant literature . * previous work employs vhcsto stabilize desired repetitive behaviors for underactuated mechanical systems @xcite . canudas - de - wit and collaborators @xcite propose a technique to stabilize a desired closed orbit that relies on enforcing a virtual constraint and on dynamically changing its geometry so as to impose that the reduced dynamics on the constraint manifold match the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator . in @xcite , canudas - de - wit , shiriaev , and collaborators employ vhcsto aid the selection of closed orbits corresponding to desired repetitive behaviors of underactuated mechanical systems . it is demonstrated that an unforced second - order system possessing an integral of motion describes the constrained motion . assuming that this unforced system has a closed orbit , a linear time - varying controller is designed that yields exponential stability of the closed orbit . with the exception of @xcite , the papers above do not guarantee the invariance of the vhcfor the closed loop system . the idea of event - triggered dynamic vhcshas appeared in the work by morris and grizzle in @xcite where the authors construct a hybrid invariant manifold for the closed - loop dynamics of biped robots by updating the vhcparameters after each impact with the ground . this approach is similar in spirit to the one presented in this paper . in section [ sec : stab : shir ] , we discuss the differences between the method presented in this article and the ones in @xcite . we also discuss the conceptual similarities between the method presented in this article and the one in @xcite . * organization . * this article is organized as follows . we review preliminaries in section [ sec : stab : prelim ] . the formal problem statement and our solution strategy are presented in section [ sec : stab : prob_stat ] . in section [ sec : stab : dynconstr ] we present dynamic vhcs . in section [ sec : stab : s_control ] we design the input of the double -

based orbital stabilization problem involves augmenting the dynamics with a double - integrator. we provide a general theorem relating the stability of a closed orbit to the controllability of a linear periodic system, for which we give an explicit representation. leveraging this result, we design a feedback loop to exponentially stabilize the orbit relative to the manifold in order to maintain a certain speed profile. + + key words : self -

champaign, il 61801, usa. a problem that arises frequently is the stabilization of equilibrium states that are macroscopic in nature. it is well - known that a system that is stable in a harmonic oscillating mechanical sense ( e.g., in the oscillating harmonic oscillators ) is always stable in the harmonic oscillator state, in contrast to the state that is usually unstable in the dynamical sense. henceforth, it has been asked what conditions a given system has to meet to have an _ exponentially stable equilibrium state _, i.e., a closed statespace such that for any value of the system is stable. one of the conditions that have been discussed in the literature is that the system must be homeomorphic to a regular curve of diffeomorphic to either the unit circle or the real line. this is known as the _ closed orbit problem_. in the case of systems of linear, periodic, or quasi - periodic forms, the closed - loop state is stable for long periods of time, in interesting ways, because almost all orbits are essentially closed. however, it is not known in general that the same is true for systems that operate in a nonlinear regime, in other words, for any system that operates in a stationary state. this paper provides a general solution to this problem if and only in the context of convex regular systems. in turn, our solution determines the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a locally lipschitz continuous feedback, such that the conve",0.16318785578747627,"necessary and sufficient conditions for a relation @xmath55 to be a regular vhcof order @xmath48 are given in the following proposition . prop : stabilization ] let @xmath55 be a regular vhcof order @xmath48 for system with associated constraint manifold @xmath61 in .

@xcite , and the electronic state of this acceptor is investigated insufficiently . the possibility of using negative muons to study the behaviour of acceptor impurities in diamond arises from the fact that capture of a negative muon by a carbon atom results in the formation of a muonic atom @xmath9b with an electron shell that is analogous to that of the boron atom . the evolution of the polarization of @xmath10 in the 1s atomic state depends on the interaction of the muon spin with the electron shell of the muonic atom and on the interactions of this muonic atom ( acceptor centre ) with the crystal lattice . providing that the electron shell of @xmath9b has a nonzero magnetic moment ( paramagnetic @xmath9b ) , there is a hyperfine interaction between the muon and the electron shell . the efficiency of the hyperfine interaction depends on the relaxation rate @xmath11 of the magnetic moment of @xmath9b and on the hyperfine interaction constant @xmath12 . according to theoretical calculations @xcite , relaxation of the muon spin and a paramagnetic shift of its precession frequency are expected for @xmath13 . under the assumption of an isotropic hyperfine

b@xmath14 + @xmath15 ) state . in the latter case a hole is localized in vicinity of the ac . at equilibrium the boron acceptor in diamond is expected to be paramagnetic below @xmath16 k. in earlier experiments @xcite we observed no frequency shift of the muon spin precession in diamond at the level of @xmath17 . the goal of the present experiment was to improve the accuracy of the muon spin precession frequency measurement .","the effect of paramagnetic ( magnetic ) defects on the muon spin precession frequency of the electrons in polycrystalline diamond was studied by @xmath0li spin resonance spectroscopy. it was found that the paramagnetic centre of the muonic atom in the 1s state of graphite has covalent chemical bonds with the three nearest carbon atoms and the fourth carbon atom has an unpaired spin ( one dangling bond ). the susceptibility of the carbon atom was found to be constant in the magnetic field of 14 koe. the effects of magnetic impurities, formed either by hydrogen or nitrogen ( the diameters of 3.5 mm and 1.3 mm ) in the acceptor centre, were studied with the quantum design squid magnetometer. the results of the measurements are presented in detail in magnetic fields of 95.2 oe and 20.0 koe for both samples. the durant magnetic moments of negative muons in graphite exhibit a linear dependence of their magnetic moment on the external magnetic field in the temperature range from 0 to 50 koe, and on the temperature variation of their frequency shift. in contrast, no linear dependence is observed in the synthetic carbon diamond sample studied. the development of an efficient toolbox for the measurement of magnetic properties of materials is one of the main goals of modern research. in this context, the search for new phases of nanophotonic compounds is of great importance because of their great potential for technological applications and the high tunability in manipulating and manipulating of magnetic moments. of particular interest are antiferromagnetic carbon allotropes such as n@xmath1 crystals. for example, the artificial crystals based on carbon nanotubes are highly desirable due to their outstanding mechanical properties and facile mechanical properties @xcite. synthetic diamond is relatively well isolated from environmental effects and its high optical depth makes it an ideal test bed for nanophotonics and quantum information processing. in the past few years a lot of research efforts are focused on its magnetic properties and on its mechanical properties ( e.g. the tunability of muon dynamics and precession ). recently, a large number of theoretical predictions and simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of magnetic and impurity effects on the mechanical properties of diamond materials. the predictions are based on the theoretical prediction of a simple model, namely, linear temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for muon rotations, and it is expected that the presence

the acceptor centre in both @xmath55b@xmath54 and ( @xmath55b@xmath72 + h ) states . in diamond relaxation of the magnetic moments of @xmath55b@xmath54 and ( @xmath55b@xmath57 + h ) direct , raman ,

the leading filament erupts first and the remaining parts seem to be dragged by the trailing filament. therefore, the dynamical mechanism likely dominates in this case. we also discuss the implications of the observed in this event on the formation of an asymmetric ( slow rise ) oscillation.",0.2465753424657534,"the period and the velocity amplitude measured in the plane of sky of the oscillation were about 2 hours and 4.2 km s@xmath1 , respectively . in addition to the detection of the oscillation in extreme ultraviolet and h@xmath2 , we discovered that the oscillation was seen also in microwave . we examine the magnetic - field data to study the mechanism of the excitation of the oscillation . in such a long filament , it is probably possible that the filament loses its equilibrium in a the oscillation in a part of the filament during the slow rise is evidence that that part of the filament still retained an equilibrium . in this paper we presented the observations of a large amplitude oscillation of the polar crown filament in its pre - eruption , slowly rising phase . the oscillation was seen only in a part of the filament , and seems to be a standing oscillation rather than a propagating wave . such an oscillation has not been reported during the more than ten years of norh observations ( although we have not done a systematic survey for such events , so this does not mean that ours is the only such event ) , and we believe that this is the first observation of spatially resolved filament oscillation by microwave imaging . in contrast to previous observations of large - amplitude filament oscillations , there were no flares or even microflares associated with the excitation of the filament . however , we found that a filament barb connected near an emerging flux disappeared and seems to be ejected at the onset of the oscillation . we believe that reconnection between the emerging flux and the barb caused the ejection that blew the filament to excite the oscillation . the large - amplitude oscillation occurred in the slow - rise phase of the filament , and only a part of the filament exhibited the oscillation . the oscillation is evidence that the oscillating part of the filament still retained a nonlinearly stable equilibrium during the slow rise . filament and prominence seismology is a powerful tool , not only for measuring the physical parameters , but also for diagnosing the stability and hence the trigger mechanism of filament eruption . dt acknowledges the support from pparc .",0.2585438335809807,-0.011968491115227298

( 2008 ) and find that star formation efficiency ( sfe ), as measured from the h@xmath0 m emission, is enhanced in the spiral arms relative to the overall trend. we do not find any evidence for a triggering of molecular cloud formation, though a triggering may be implied based on the higher sfe. combined with our recent result that 30 % of resolved star formation tracers occur in the interarm region, we find no significant evidence for shock - triggered star formation. the triggering scenario would predict that higher arm strengths and hence shock strengths should lead to higher star formation rates and thus more young, blue stars. thus, despite a triggering scenario, the effect that spiral arms have on the net production of stars should still be small irrespective of triggering. we find that, even if triggering is invoked to explain the high sfe, the enhanced star formation occurs only for a relatively narrow range of arm pixel fractions. this is because the molecular gas, which provides the fuel for star formation, is poorly mixed with the ambient interstellar medium.

second , the interaction of the yarkovsky effect with resonances has very different outcomes : outside resonances , the semimajor axis undergoes a secular drift , while inside a mean motion resonance the semimajor axis is locked and other elements can undergo a secular drift . inside a secular resonance the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : meanmot ] we deal with the specific problems of families formed by asteroids locked inside the strongest mean motion resonances with jupiter , namely @xmath2 ( hildas ) , @xmath0 ( trojans ) , and @xmath1 ( griquas ) . in section [ s : secres ] we discuss the families affected by secular resonances ( involving the perihelia and nodes of the asteroid and the planets jupiter and/or saturn ) . in section [ s : complex ] we present two successful interpretations of families with strange shapes and many interlopers . in section [ s : obstest ] we discuss the families for which we either have not found a consistent collisional model , or we have found a model ( and computed an age ) but there are still problems requiring dedicated observational efforts . in section [ there we found family 1911 with a good age determination and family 153 of the _ eroded _ type , that is which can be seen visually in the plots in the proper @xmath204 plane but can not be confirmed by the statistical tests of the hcm method . , we are presenting in this paper a new classification which identifies a number of families by using synthetic proper elements and a full hcm method . hcm is well established and has been succesfully applied to the main asteroid belt , but the results in the trojan swarms indicate that families there have a very different structure . this implies that all trojan families are _ fossil _ families , frozen with the original field of relative velocities , which are small for cratering families , for the fragmentation case somewhat larger , but still limited to the order of the escape velocity from the parent body . thus we find no way to estimate the ages of the families , while they can be a reliable source of information on the original velocity field immediately after the collision . we have found a new family among the griquas , locked in the 2/1 resonance with jupiter . we have analysed 6 large families affected by secular resonances , mostly the nonlinear ones . we have used a numerical calibration method , which has shown in all cases that the secular resonances do not affect significanly the secular change of proper @xmath4 , thus the v - shape method in the @xmath199 plane can be used to compute the age in the standard way ( as in paper iii ) .",0.2663975782038345,-0.03971178193410704
0805.1166,"one of the most surprising consequences of quantum mechanics is the nonlocal correlation of a multi - particle system observable in joint - detection of distant particle - detectors . ghost imaging is one of such phenomena . taking a photograph of an object , traditionally , we need to face a camera to the object . but with ghost imaging , we can image the object by pointing a ccd camera towards the light source , rather than towards the object . ghost imaging is reproduced at quantum level by a non - factorizable point - to - point image - forming correlation between two photons . two types of ghost imaging have been experimentally demonstrated since 1995 . type - one ghost imaging uses entangled photon pairs as the light source . the non - factorizable image - forming correlation is the result of a nonlocal constructive - destructive interference among a large number of biphoton amplitudes , a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet indistinguishable alternative ways for the photon pair to produce a joint - detction event between distant photodetectors . type - two ghost imaging uses chaotic light . the type - two non - factorizable image - forming correlation is caused by the superposition between paired two - photon amplitudes , or the symmetrized effective two - photon wavefunction , corresponding to two different yet indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a join - detection event by two independent photons . the multi - photon interference nature of ghost imaging determines its peculiar features : ( 1 ) it is nonlocal ; ( 2 ) its imaging resolution differs from that of classical ; and ( 3 ) the type - two ghost image is turbulence - free . ghost imaging has attracted a great deal of attention , perhaps due to these features for certain applications . achieving these features , the realization of nonlocal multi - photon interference is a necessary condition . classical simulations , such as the man - made factorizable speckle - speckle correlation , can never have such features . + yanhua shih + department of physics + university of maryland , baltimore county , + baltimore , md 21250 , u.s.a .","the concept of optical ghost imaging was introduced by einstein - podolsky - rosen in the language of nonlocal correlations of two independent photons. it is general in nature and applies to any radiation, including thermal light. the concept of two - photon interference "" was extended by hanbury brown and twiss in 1956. despite the successful application of this concept to thermal light, there are still many open questions concerning its classical nature. in this paper, we will discuss the three main questions : is the ghost imaging phenomenon due to constructive - destructive interference between chaotic sub - fields, is it a quantum interference or a classical intensity fluctuation correlation? we will then analyze the physical mechanisms underlying type - one and type - two ghost imaging in terms of the biphoton amplitudes of an entangled photon - pair using the equations of motion of a nonlinear crystal pumped by a continuous wave ( cw ) and the dynamics of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ). the imaging lens is a focal length- and background - dependent lens which illuminates the light passing through the aperture. we envision the lensless ghost imaging setup as a lens that consists of a pair of independent nonlinear crystals of different thickness. the point - to - point correlation between the object and the image planes is considered as the result of a statistical correlation of intensity fluctuations. this is contrary to classical optics where markovian correlations dominate. however, despite the similarity in the nature of thermal light and the proposed theory of ghost imaging, the opposite may happen : it might be true that chaotic radiations propagate to any transverse plane in a random and chaotic manner. this then allows for a simple explanation of the experiment of pittman _ et al. _ [ phys. rev. lett. * 95 *, 194102 ( 1995 ) ] : any radiation starting from a point on the object plane will collapse "" to a unique pointon the image plane. similar to that of type - 1, it involves the nonlocal superposition of two- photon amplitudes. contrary to the case of physical optics, the ghost image is a reproduction, either magnified or demagnified, of the illuminated object. furthermore, unlike classical light, objects will experience unequal distance propagations to superpose destructively at all other points on the image surface. we will conclude that the concepts of quantum and classical ghost imaging are not equivalent and should not be considered to apply to each other.",0.18338108882521487,"[ fig : projection-1 ] that the point - to - point relationship is the result of _ constructive - destructive interference_. the radiation fields coming from a point on the object plane will experience equal distance propagation to superpose constructively at one unique point on the image plane , and experience unequal distance propagations to superpose destructively at all other points on the image plane . type - one and type - two ghost imaging , in certain aspects , exhibit a similar point - to - point imaging - forming function as that of classical except the ghost image is reproducible only in the joint - detection between two independent photodetectors , and the point - to - point imaging - forming function is in the form of second - order correlation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the joint - detection counting rate between photodetectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the signal photon passes through a convex lens of 400 mm focal length and illuminates a chosen aperture ( mask ) . these independent sub - intensities simply add together , yielding a constant total intensity in space and in time on any transverse plane . in the lensless ghost imaging setup we have concluded and will show that the partial point - to - point correlation between the object and image planes in type - two ghost imaging is the result of _ two - photon interference_. similar to that of type - one , it involves the nonlocal superposition of two - photon amplitudes , a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a joint - detection event @xcite . different from that of type - one , the joint - detection events observed in type - two ghost imaging are triggered by two randomly distributed independent photons . it is interesting to see that the quantum mechanical concept of _ two - photon interference _ is applicable to classical "" thermal light .- function . ] in fact , this is not the first time in the history of physics we apply quantum mechanical concepts to thermal light . the partial point - to - point correlation of thermal radiation is not a new discovery either . it is then reasonable to ask : is the near - field type - two ghost imaging with thermal light a simple classical effect similar to that of hbt ?

1108.4433,"during most stages of stellar evolution the nuclear burning of lighter to heavier elements results in a radial composition profile which is stabilizing against buoyant acceleration , with light material residing above heavier material . however , under some circumstances , such as off - center ignition , the composition profile resulting from nuclear burning can be destabilizing , and characterized by an outwardly increasing mean molecular weight . the potential for instabilities under these circumstances , and the consequences that they may have on stellar structural evolution , remain largely unexplored . in this paper we study the development and evolution of instabilities associated with unstable composition gradients in regions which are initially stable according to linear schwarzschild and ledoux criteria . in particular , we explore the mixing taking place under various conditions with multi - dimensional hydrodynamic convection models based on stellar evolutionary calculations of the core helium flash in a 1.25 star , the core carbon flash in a 9.3star , and of oxygen shell burning in a star with a mass of 23 . the results of our simulations reveal a mixing process associated with regions having outwardly increasing mean molecular weight that reside below convection zones . the mixing is not due to overshooting from the convection zone , nor is it due directly to thermohaline mixing which operates on a timescale several orders of magnitude larger than the simulated flows . instead , the mixing appears to be due to the presence of a wave field induced in the stable layers residing beneath the convection zone which enhances the mixing rate by many orders of magnitude and allows a thermohaline type mixing process to operate on a dynamical , rather than thermal , timescale . the mixing manifests itself in the form of overdense and cold blob - like structures originating from density fluctuations at the lower boundary of convective shell and ` ` shooting '' down into the core . they are enriched with nuclearly processed material , hence leaving behind traces of higher mean molecular weight . in these regions we find that initially smooth composition gradients steepen into stair - step like profiles in which homogeneous , mixed regions are separated by composition jumps . these step like profiles are then seen to evolve by a process of interface migration driven by turbulent entrainment . we discuss our results in terms of related laboratory phenomena and associated theoretical developments . we also discuss the degree to which the simulated mixing rates depend on the numerical resolution , and what future steps can be taken to capture the mixing rates accurately .","we present results from numerical simulations of off - center helium- and carbon - flash convection in two and three dimensions ( 2d and 3d ), respectively. these simulations include a detailed exploration of a mixing process that takes place below the temperature maximum immediately after convection starts. associated with the mixing is the redistribution of composition and entropy within the stable layers that reside beneath the shell convection zone. these layers form ` ` fingers '' of high mean molecular weight material which traverse the mixing region. these fingers are essentially tracer of material trasport taking place across the stable layer. the speed of mixing in these stable layers is comparable to the angular displacement speed across the unstable layer. we find that the mixing takes place against a background state which is initially stable, but as the convection rate increases and the background state disappears, the fingers trace the location of the unstable mixing region and the rate of mixing increases. this mixing process is not observed to operate below the burning shell in the oxygen burning case. we identify the new mixing process with a coupling between the kinetic energy of the convective shell and the layers which reside below it, a coupling which has potentially significant consequences for the star s structure and evolution. some salient features of the mixing process are not observed in the 3d simulations. the 2d model hefl.2d.1 contains small circular vortices which are unstable to thermohaline mixing on a dynamical timescale, and core helium flash simulations do not show significant temperature fluctuations. we discuss these results in the context of other processes commonly encountered in stellar interiors, including penetration and overshoot, semiconvection, and salt fingering.

astro-ph0209568,"we report the discovery of two spectroscopic binaries in the field of the old open cluster m67 s1063 and s1113 whose positions in the color - magnitude diagram place them @xmath0 1 mag below the subgiant branch . a rosat study of m67 independently discovered these stars to be x -

motion properties of the binary are consistent with it being a cluster member. both binaries show photometric variability on timescales longer than 18 days, but with no clear period variability for periods greater than 20 days. in the context of this study, we recommend using the single field - star interloper model to account for the multiple radial - velocity measurements of both stars. this model requires that the uv flux from each star be balanced against the flux from the co - moving primary star, and that the ratio of primary to secondary v fluxes is set by the distance to the cluster center. the geometric argument strongly supports this interpretation, though the variability of the composite light with the orbital period can not be fully ruled out for the two stars. if the variability is caused by asymmetries in the photometric light distribution, then both stars should be highly reddened, with a mean reddening e(b - v ) = 0.14 - 0.18. in contrast to m67, the entire galactic reddening in the direction of our cluster is only 0.03 mag, thus the implied enhanced reddening of s1097 is likely centered on the primary. ground - based observations are not consistent with the existence of warm circumstellar dust in this system, and we suggest that the x - ray emission is due to rapid rotational motion. finally, we note that both stars show significant absorption in the ca ii h and k lines, and both are likely chromospherically active stars.",0.22686567164179103,"we have underway a multi -

1004.3992,"the spontaneous onset of magnetic reconnection in thin collisionless current sheets is shown to result from a thermal - anisotropy driven magnetic weibel - mode , generating seed - magnetic field x - points in the centre of the current layer . the idea of magnetic reconnection as the main plasma process that converts stored magnetic energy into kinetic energy originates from the intuitive geometric picture of annihilating antiparallel magnetic field lines when approaching each other ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . observations in space have unambiguously confirmed the presence of reconnection under collisionless conditions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) when the fluid theoretical approaches break down . however , no convincing theoretical argument for the spontaneous occurrence of reconnection has so far been given . in collisionless numerical simulations reconnection is artificially ignited ( cf . , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , mostly by _ ad hoc _ imposing a seed x - point in the current sheet separating the anti - parallel fields . the ongoing search for the mechanism of spontaneous onset of collisionless reconnection points to the ` missing microphysics ' in thin current sheets . in the present letter we show that instability of the inner current layer gives rise to the self - consistent generation of local magnetic fields @xmath0 transverse to the current layer . such local fields are equivalent to the generation of microscopic seed x - points in the current sheet centre and are capable of spontaneously igniting reconnection as is known from two - dimensional pic particle simulations . since in an ideal current sheet ions and electrons become non - magnetic on their respective inertial scales @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the plasma frequencies of ions and electrons , ( classical ) collisionless convective transport of magnetic fields into the current layer takes place up to a vertical distance @xmath3 from the centre of the current sheet . the region between @xmath4 is known as the ` hall - current ' @xcite or ( mistakenly , as there is no diffusion present ) ` ion - diffusion ' region . being a by - product of thinning of the current layer , the hall currents are presumably not involved in the reconnection process proper . they close along the magnetic field by electrons that are accelerated in the oblique lower - hybrid - drift / modified - two - stream instability driven by magnetised hall - electrons on the non - magnetic ion background thereby coupling the reconnection site to the auroral ionosphere @xcite . when speaking of a current sheet , we refer to ideal current sheets separating strictly antiparallel fields . the observational paradigm of a reconnecting current sheet is the magnetospheric tail - current sheet . this current sheet is not ideal in the above sense as it is embedded into a quasi - dipolar field which still might preserve a weak rudimentary ( normal ) magnetic field component @xmath5pointing northward . this @xmath5 component re - magnetises the central - sheet electrons and affects the evolution of ( collisionless ) tearing modes @xcite . nevertheless below , when using numbers , we will for reasons of resolution refer to conditions in the magnetotail even though our theory might better apply to the magnetopause , interplanetary space or astrophysics . in principle , observation of the electron - inertial ( ` electron - diffusion ' ) region is difficult because of its narrow width . unambiguous observations do not yet exist . at the magnetopause , in particular , very narrow electron layers have sometimes been reported assuming that they relate to the electron - inertial region during reconnection ( for a recent discussion of the experimental prospects of resolving the electron - inertial region cf . , * ? ? ? * ) .","the mechanism for spontaneous magnetospheric reconnection weibel instability is discussed here with emphasis on the small - scale ( @xmath0 m ) seed - x points that are expected to grow from thermal fluctuations in the magnetotail current sheet. weibel instabilities are low frequency ( about zero ) electromagnetic instabilities which are capable of generating large ( tens of khz ) magnetic field amplitudes without the need for any magnetic dynamo mechanism. the small size of the magnetic field component in this case provides seed x - points on geophysically reasonable spatial and temporal scales. in the antiparallel case these may evolve into large - scale vortex - like structures, and spontaneous reconnection between adjacent magnetic layers is likely to occur spontaneously. - magnetic fields are observed not only in condensed astrophysical plasmas, but also in the geomagnetic tail ( where they are believed to grow up to a level comparable to the external magnetic field ) and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) systems @xcite. the origin of these magnetic fields is still unclear, although recent experimental evidence suggests their presence in planetary interiors. the main problem in modelling these large magnetic field systems is then to understand the connection between the emerging magnetic field structures and the already existing ( magnetic ) current flow. in this letter we explore this problem both analytically and with numerical simulations. we hypothesise that the growing instability is driven by an increase in the temperature anisotropy of the incoming electrons, i.e. when the electron pressure is anisotropic. the weibel field is generated in the plane parallel to both anisotropies, but perpendicular to the direction of higher thermal velocity, which in our case has been assumed as the parallel direction. thus the instability grows in a parallel plane without any external magnetic force. it is then possible to form a plasmoid - like current flow, or even a mott insulator, in the presence of magnetic fields along the current. this mechanism ( weibel self - organisation ) is of limited practical importance, as it will short - range ( e.g., within a few e - folding times ) dynamo effects which are likely to shut down existing magnetic bifurcation channels, thus limiting the ability to reconnect via weibel mode generation in the bi - maxwellian limit.",0.17430167597765361,"this may happen when two magnetised collisionless plasmas of finite lateral extension collide . in the magnetotail current sheet ( known as electron and ion phase space holes ) which trap a substantial part of the electrons and heat them in the direction along the current drift velocity . this is the maximum angle the wavevector assumes in the weibel - field vertexes . for @xmath72 and @xmath73 this in order to infer how long it takes the instability to achieve substantial magnetic field amplitudes we need to estimate the magnetic thermal fluctuation level @xmath80 from where the weibel instability starts growing in the presence of the electron pressure anisotropy ( thermally fluctuating magnetic fields will be denoted by lower case letters ) . magnetic thermal levels have recently been estimated @xcite . from basic fluctuation theory @xcite the spectral energy density of the zero - frequency thermally - anisotropic weibel mode can be written @xmath81 ^ 2}%\nonumber\ ] ] the 0-subscript refers to vanishing real frequency . here the weibel instability in this case excites an entire spectrum of magnetic field structures in the current layer . in the geomagnetic tail the present approach has so far only implicitly taken into account the narrow width of the non - magnetic central current region which imposes boundary conditions on the evolution of the weibel mode . as demonstrated , this imposes limits on wave number and propagation angles of the weibel mode . clearly the parallel case is preferred as the antiparallel case generates small - scale current bifurcation . on the other hand , this is possible because the evolution of the weibel mode is completely independent of the presence of the external field . the inner current region decays into a ` magnetic vortex street ' consisting of ( electronic ) plasmoids and seed - x points . one may ask what structure of the field and current layer is expected in the direction parallel to the current flow . , it is the thermal - anisotropy driven weibel instability which provides the magnetic field to penetrate the inner region of the current layer , generates a local normal field component @xmath5 and , by producing short wavelength magnetic vortices and vertexes , it may ignite reconnection on a time scale of tens of seconds to few minutes in the magnetotail . this is in rough agreement with observations , e.g. in the magnetotail , and is sufficiently short for initiating magnetospheric substorms . this logically consistent chain of processes provides a satisfactory mechanism for the spontaneous self -

isolated moduli or ` ` rare regions '' where neural activity remains mostly localized generating slow dynamics and very large responses to perturbations @xcite . brain function requires coordinated or coherent neural activity at a wide range of scales , thus , neural synchronization is a major theme in neuroscience @xcite . synchronization plays a key role in vision @xcite , memory @xcite , neural communication @xcite , and other cognitive functions @xcite . an excess of synchrony results in pathologies such as epilepsy or parkinsonian disease , while neurological deficit of synchronization has been related to autism and schizophrenia @xcite . our aim here is to scrutinize the special features of synchronization dynamics @xcite as exemplified by the canonical kuramoto model @xcite running on top of the best available human connectome mapping @xcite . this consists of a network of @xmath0 nodes , each of them representing a mesoscopic population of neurons able to produce self - sustained oscillations @xcite whose mutual connections are encoded by a symmetric weighted connectivity matrix @xmath1 @xcite . the validity of this admittedly simplistic kuramoto model as a convenient tool to explore the generic features of complex brain dynamics at a large scales has been recently emphasized in the literature @xcite . here , we uncover the existence of a novel intermediate phase for synchronization dynamics similar in spirit to the griffiths phases discussed above which stems from the hierarchical modular organization of the hc and which gives rise to very complex and rich synchronization dynamical patterns . we identify this novel phase as the optimal regime for the brain to harbor complex behavior , large dynamical repertoires , and optimal trade - offs between local segregation and global integration . the kuramoto dynamics on a generic network ( see @xcite for a nice and comprehensive review ) is defined by : @xmath2 , \label{eq : kuramoto}\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the phase at node @xmath4 at time @xmath5 . the intrinsic frequencies @xmath6 accounting for node heterogeneity are extracted from some arbitrary distribution function @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the elements of the @xmath9 connectivity matrix @xmath1 , and @xmath10 is the coupling strength . time delays , noise , and phase frustration could also be straightforwardly implemented . the kuramoto order parameter is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 gauges the overall coherence and @xmath13 is the average global phase . in large populations of well - connected oscillators without frequency dispersion , perfect coherence ( @xmath14 ) emerges for any coupling strength ; on the other hand , frequency heterogeneity leads to a phase transition at some critical value of @xmath10 , separating a coherent steady state from an incoherent one @xcite . analytical insight onto this phase transition can be obtained using the celebrated ott - antonsen ( oa ) ansatz , allowing for a projection of the high - dimensional dynamics into an evolution equation for @xmath15 with remarkable accuracy in the large-@xmath16 limit @xcite . , for kuramoto dynamics on the hc network for a specific and fixed set of frequencies extracted from a @xmath17 gaussian distribution . a broad intermediate regime separates the incoherent phase ( low @xmath10 ) from the synchronous one ( high @xmath10 ) . in this regime , coherence increases with @xmath10 in an intermittent fashion , and with strong dependence on the frequency realization . b ) raster plot of individual phases ( vertical axis ) showing local rather than global synchrony and illustrating the coexistence of coherent and incoherent nodes ( @xmath18 ) as time runs . c ) @xmath19 for @xmath20 values of @xmath10 ( arrows in the main plot ) . d ) adjacency matrix of the hc network with nodes ordered to emphasize its modular structure as highlighted by a community detection algorithm ( main text ) , keeping the partition into the @xmath21 hemispheres ( dashed lines ) . intra - modular connections ( shown in color ) are dense while inter - modular ones ( grey ) are limited to tiny subsets , acting as interfaces between moduli . integration between hemispheres is mostly carried out by the @xmath22 central moduli . this plot visually illustrates the hierarchical modular organization of the human connectome network.,width=453 ]","simple models of synchronization dynamics exhibit an unexpectedly rich phenomenology when operating on top of empirical human brain networks, hinting at the presence of a hidden structure which hinders collective coherence. what is more striking is that such a complex behavior would be impossible to obtain in networks with much stronger connectivity patterns, such as scale free - networks or high - degree random graphs, which already shows strong signals of the ideal hierarchical structure reflected in the human connectome. here we study a family of hierarchical modular networks describing the evolution of the attractor dynamics in the hubble network ( hc ), revealing the existence of an intermediate regime between the coherent and incoherent stretched - exponential asymptotic behavior. this is characterized by broad quasi - periodic temporal oscillations of @xmath0, whose onsets are located within well - separated levels ( which we call transition points ), that as a matter of fact can be identified by using standard community detection algorithms. two distinct transitions are found in the level of internal coherence : at low levels, local order emerges out of a bottom - up ordering process in which progressively larger communities with inherently different timescales are coherent. at higher levels, i.e. at the collective level, local coherences prevail over a broad range of inter - moduli bandwidths allowing the system to escape from metastable and chimera - like states with traits of local coherence at different hierarchical levels. a prominent feature of the hc hierarchical modular structure is the strong separation between two different levels of coherence a regime characterized by metastable coherence and an oscillatory pattern in which the system remains trapped between two levels due to the absence of a phase lag. this, together with the heterogeneous frequencies at the contact nodes ( interfaces ), suggests that the system is on the verge of achieving regime of complete global synchronization. the result is a complex synchronization landscape, which is especially rich and diverse in the intermediate regime put forward here. likely additional realistic ingredients such as explicit phase frustration and time delays to our simplistic approach should add complexity to the structural frustration effect reported here. it is also expected that more refined models including neuro - realistic ingredients including time delays would generate similar results.",0.12803532008830024,"we have performed a computational study of the kuramoto model running on top of the hc network ( details are given in the methods section ) . our results reveal the existence of an intermediate regime placed between the coherent and the incoherent phase ( see fig.1 ) . local coherence emerged for large enough values of the phase lag . our two - block model shows that the presence of `` structural bottlenecks '' between moduli combined with heterogeneous frequencies at their contact nodes ( interfaces ) are essential ingredients to generate a broad region of global oscillations in @xmath53 , even in the absence of phase lag . it was noted in the past that synchronization in a synthetic network with hubs could be limited to those hubs by tuning clustering properties , and global order could be attained in a monotonous step - like fashion upon increasing @xmath10 @xcite . the emergence of chimera - like states and anomalously slow dynamics we suggest to go beyond the single - level modular network model and study hierarchical modular networks ( hmn ) in which moduli exists within moduli in a nested way at various scales @xcite . this is obviously not the case for a regular lattice , where the spectral gap is always well defined . a fractal lattice or an ordered tree , simple models of synchronization dynamics exhibit an unexpectedly rich phenomenology when operating on top of empirical human brain networks . this complexity includes oscillatory behavior of the order parameter suggesting the existence of relatively isolated structural communities or moduli , that as a matter of fact can be identified by using standard community detection algorithms . aimed at unveiling this complex behavior we have introduced a family of hierarchical modular networks and studied them in order to assess what structural properties are required in order to reproduce the complex synchronization patterns observed in brain networks . in the absence of frequency dispersion , perfect coherence is achieved in synthetic hierarchical networks by following a bottom - up ordering dynamics in which progressively larger communities with inherently different timescales become coherent ( see @xcite ) . this structural complexity brings about anomalously - slow dynamics at very large timescales . observe that the hc , in spite of being a coarse - grained mapping of a brain network , already shows strong signals of this ideal hierarchical architecture as reflected in its anomalously slow synchronization dynamics as well as in the presence of non - degenerate eigenvalues in the lower edge of its laplacian spectrum , acting as a fingerprint of structural heterogeneity and complexity . we stress that such a complex phenomenology would be impossible to obtain in networks with stronger connectivity patterns ( e.g. with the small world property ) such as scale free - networks or high - degree random graphs . even the generic presence of simple communities may not be sufficient to grant the emergence of frustration : the uniqueness of the human connectome , and of hierarchical modular networks in general , resides in the strong separation into distinct levels , which the synchronization dynamics is able to resolve only at well - separated values of the coupling @xmath10 . accordingly , it has been suggested that the brain is routinely exploring different states or attractors @xcite and that in order to enhance spontaneous switching between attractors brain networks should operate close to a critical point , allowing for large intrinsic fluctuations which on their turn entail attractor `` surfing '' and give access to highly varied functional configurations @xcite and , in particular , to maximal variability of phase synchrony @xcite .",0.16258064516129034,-0.0345453250729901

point for the _ swp _ camera due to several revisions of wavelength calibration coefficients used for _ iuesips_. smaller offsets are present for the _ lwr _ camera between the two processings . we also evaluated small - amplitude fluctuations in the zero - points of the _ newsips _ wavelength calibration spectra themselves . in the case of the _ swp _ camera , these variations are too complicated to have been completely removed in the _ newsips _ wavelength calibration . we also examine wavelength zero - point disparities between data obtained both through the small and large entrance apertures as well as for observations made by different target acquisitions of faint and bright stars . we also find that statistical differences between these alternative observing modes are virtually nil . for large - aperture observations the dominant error source is the placement of the target in the aperture . these give rise to non - gaussian , extended tails "" in apparent velocity . we also searched for spurious trends with time . except for a possible trend for faint objects with _ swp _ camera data , we can not detect significant dependences with time . additionally , we discovered a trend with telescope focus for datasets derived from intensive monitoring campaigns of bright stars . these exhibit a repeatable , one - day radial velocity variation "" with a semi - amplitude of nearly 3 km s@xmath0 . this pattern appears to be a by - product of fluctuations in telescope focus caused by operational procedures to maintain the ambient instrument temperature . in the second part of the paper , we measure the mean zero -

1107.2936,"tiny grains such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) have been thought to dramatically reduce the coupling between gas and magnetic fields in weakly ionized gas such as in protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) because they provide tremendous surface area to recombine free electrons . the presence of tiny grains in ppds thus raises the question of whether the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is able to drive rapid accretion to be consistent with observations . charged tiny grains have similar conduction properties as ions , whose presence leads to qualitatively new behaviors in the conductivity tensor , characterized by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the number densities of free electrons and all other charged species respectively . in particular , ohmic conductivity becomes dominated by charged grains rather than electrons when @xmath3 exceeds about @xmath4 , and hall and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) coefficients are reduced by a factor of @xmath5 in the ad dominated regime relative to that in the ohmic regime . applying the methodology of bai ( 2011 ) , we find that in ppds , when pahs are sufficiently abundant ( @xmath6 per h@xmath7 molecule ) , there exists a transition radius @xmath8 of about @xmath9 au , beyond which the mri active layer extends to the disk midplane . at @xmath10 , the optimistically predicted mri -

branes attached to each five - brane should be @xmath16 and 0 , respectively , where d4-branes on the left count as positive and on the right as negative . the classical limit now corresponds to taking @xmath17 separately for each group . in other words we first decouple for example the second factor by @xmath18 , giving @xmath19 , and then take @xmath20 to localize the d4-branes at the zeroes of @xmath21 . similarly for the su(@xmath22 ) factor . this reduces the curve to the usual ten dimensional brane configuration of a product of groups , studied for example in @xcite . before examining other gauge groups in detail we will discuss the role of the symmetries of the curves and how they will translate to orientifolds in the brane pictures .","in the last few years a lot of work has been devoted to the theory of ten dimensional branes and the attempts have been made to understand the transformations that produce them. for example, in @xmath0 the weyl group has been extensively studied, but for other gauge groups it is still not clear to what extent such a formalism can be applied. in this paper we propose a generalization of the toda - system which allows to three - dimensional brane diagrams, in particular to the world - volume gauge theory. we argue that it is possible to construct these diagrams with g@xmath1-branes but it is not possible to do it in the ten dimensional limit. as a result we suggest a direction in which the branes do not correspond to branes but to compact surfaces. this direction is compatible with the atiyah -

1302.5035,"through a combination of spin - exchange collisions in a magnetic field and optical pumping , it is possible to cool a gas of atoms without requiring the loss of atoms from the gas . we investigated this technique , collision assisted zeeman cooling , using @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb . we experimentally confirmed that our measured two isotope caz cooling rate agreed with a cooling rate predicted though a simple analytic model . as part of the measured cooling rate , we quantitatively characterized the heating rates associated with our actual implementation of this cooling technique and found hyperfine - changing collisions to be a significant limitation for the @xmath2rb gas mixture . we comment on the prospects for improving the cooling performance beyond that presented in this work . there are numerous techniques @xcitethat have been theoretically and/or experimentally evaluated for cooling gasses of ultracold atoms below the limits associated with standard laser cooling techniques such as doppler cooling @xcite and optical molasses cooling @xcite . by far the most common of these cooling techniques is evaporative cooling and as such it has a long history of being effective , robust , and straightforward to implement @xcite . there are reasons to investigate non - evaporative cooling techniques , however . there is intrinsic physics interest in studying the ways in which ultracold gases can be cooled . evaporative cooling requires the loss of atoms from the trapped gas , which is generally undesirable . a rapid non - evaporative cooling scheme would have the potential to simplify experimental apparatuses by eliminating , for instance , the need for atom transport between different regions of the vacuum system @xcite . finally , in non - evaporative cooling the link between the cooling mechanism and the potential confining the ultracold atoms is reduced , allowing for more flexibility in tailoring the confining potential @xcite . in previously published work , a non - evaporation - based cooling technique called collision - assisted zeeman ( caz ) cooling was presented theoretically @xcite . at the heart of this cooling technique are spin - exchange collisions that transfer kinetic energy to zeeman energy that is then subsequently removed from the ultracold gas via optical pumping . we present an extension to caz cooling by considering caz cooling with two different types of atoms present in the gas being cooled rather than one . we refer to this two - type - of - atom based cooling scheme as 2-caz . while cooling two different types of atoms introduces complexity , it leads to predicted advantages for caz cooling both specific to the cooling technique itself and also in more general terms through a predicted improvement in cooling rate at low temperatures . in addition to presenting 2-caz theoretically , the experimental implementation of 2-caz in an @xmath0rb/@xmath1rb system is reported . while optical trap loading behaviour and hyperfine - changing collisions prevented robust 2-caz cooling in our system , cooling rate measurements were made that allow for a comparison between experimentally realizable and theoretically predicted 2-caz performance . through these measurements , requirements for robust 2-caz cooling are better characterized and understood .","the two - component atomic cooling rate ( 2-caz ) is a promising new cooling method for a @xmath0rb gas. it is based on optically pumping two rb atoms simultaneously in a far off - resonance optical trap. this technique avoids the use of magnetic traps such as magnetic micro - traps and magnetic coils. in addition, the light - assisted spin - exchange collisions that occur due to exchange interactions in the f=2 and f=3 states of the colliding atoms are avoided. for optimal cooling parameters the atoms do not have to be in hyperfine - changing collisions. the advantages of this cooling scheme are that it is three - dimensional, the energy removed per scattered optical pumping photon is proportional to the gas temperature, and the high density of the atoms prevents hyperfine changing collisions to significantly limit the total energy in the system. however, the complications that occur in light - based methods such as reabsorption cooling impose constraints on the cooling rate. to overcome these limitations two - cavity sub - doppler cooling with two different types of atoms has been proposed. in this paper we report on an experimental realization of 2-ca z@xmath1az cooling with just one rb atom. we show that by using a simple all - optical optical pumping scheme it is possible to achieve cooling rates comparable to those that require a magnetic trapping or a large magneto - optical trap ( mots ). we also report a successful thermodynamic measurement of the on - resonance microwave excitation probability and the steady - state population of a two - atom system showing that 2caz cooling is efficient while maintaining the isotope character of the gas. the techniques used in this work demonstrate a potential for efficient cooling in a variety of situations. recent years have seen a growing interest in the cooling of heavy elements due to their potential for technological applications in spintronics and quantum information processing @xcite. for instance, spintronic devices require a low - temperature gas to be cooled below a temperature of a few hundred k. to reach the desired temperature it is necessary to cool the gas to a temperature where the majority of the electrons are in the spin - singlet / triplet ground state. to reach such a low temperature, the cooling must be performed in a regime where the magnetic field is strong enough to produce an effective zeeman field ( e.g. l2 and l3 colliding atom beams ). while laser cooling of atoms in magnetic traps is generally accomplished through laser cooling from a few tens of mev",0.17920353982300888,"* microwave measurement of @xmath0rb @xmath7 state distribution . * a microwave signal was created using a microwave generator and amplifier that is connected to a microwave antenna inside of the vacuum chamber . our data yielded an on - resonance microwave excitation probability of 0.76(9 ) and off - resonance excitation probability of 0.0047(8 ) . while there are no reabsorption effects observed for the reported conditions above , we do observe degradation in optical pumping efficiency at an order - of - magnitude more intensity for l2 and l3 . thus , the window of sufficiently high density for effective cooling and sufficiently low time spent in the f=3 state appears to be small . having the freedom to adjust the density of the optically - pumped isotope while still maintaining a high density of the non - optically - pumped isotope can result in improvements in the achievable cooling rate at low temperatures . for 2-caz cooling , this can be seen by assuming that the cooling is taking place under conditions where @xmath44 is proportional to the number of optically - pumped atoms @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is constant . for this @xmath44 , in the limit of fast optical pumping and @xmath74 compared to cooling in a gas with only one type of atom present , this ability to increase the cooling rate by reducing @xmath38 under reabsorption - limited conditions can produce orders - of - magnitude improvements in the net cooling rate . this is a general feature of non - evaporative cooling with two different types of atoms instead of one and is not limited to 2-caz . the predicted improvement in low - temperature cooling capabilities is an intriguing area of investigation if a system better - suited to 2-caz cooling than @xmath2rb can be used . in summary , we have extended caz cooling from a single - atom cooling case to one in which two different types of atoms are trapped and cooled . we have discussed the advantages of using two different types of atoms as compared to one for caz cooling . we experimentally measured 2-caz cooling in an @xmath2rb mixture and found that the measured cooling rate agrees with a simple analytical expression for the predicted cooling rate . this allowed us to interpret the limitations of 2-caz cooling for our experimental configuration . cross - isotope interference in optical trap loading and the hyperfine - changing collision rate in the @xmath2rb mixture prevented the observation of robust 2-caz cooling in our measurements and would be challenging to overcome . our analysis indicates the requirements that would be necessary for a better mixture of atoms for 2-caz cooling . predicted cooling rate improvements at low gas temperatures with the use of two different types of atoms remains an intriguing possibility for 2-caz cooling .",0.24145299145299146,-0.06224945162998258

1211.0120,"photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) are one of the most useful resources in quantum information science . two of their most important characteristics are the purity and the indistinguishability , which determine just how useful they are as a resource . we show how these characteristics can both be accessed through hong , ou and mandel ( hom ) type interferences using a single pair source . we also provide simple and intuitive analytical formulas to extract their values from the depth of the resulting interference patterns . the validity of these expressions is demonstrated by a comparison with experimental results and numerical simulations . these results provide an essential tool for both engineering spdc sources and characterizing the quantum states that they emit , which will play an increasingly important role in developing complex quantum photonic experiments . the ability to engineer and characterize quantum photonic states is of paramount importance as the complexity of the experiments in quantum information science increases . in particular , it is fundamental to be able to combine multiple independent sources and this is usually done via interference , e.g. through a bell state measurement ( bsm ) . at the heart of interference there are two concepts , two characteristics , of the photonic states : _ purity _ - how close the real photons are to the theorist s ideal of a single mode quantum object , and the _ indistinguishability _ - how alike are the different photons . indistinguishability is a fairly clear concept and its role in interference experiments has been widely accepted for some time , in contrast to the purity , which is often ignored . the indistinguishability and purity can be increased either by filtering , or by engineering the source itself . as we will see , filtering is an option for some applications , but it is also a loss factor and potentially a significant one . if one wants efficient , even scalable , multi - photon systems , then one needs to go to the source . in this article we will focus on spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) as this provides one of the most widespread and flexible resources for experiments in quantum information science . spdc sources probabilistically generate two - photon states with diverse features in space and frequency and in those degrees of freedom the photons can be anywhere from maximally entangled to totally uncorrelated . a common way to characterize spdc generated photons is by using two - photon interferometers . these were first introduced by hong , ou and mandel @xcite as a tool to measure the relatively narrow bandwidth of spdc photons . the basic idea is to observe the coincidence statistics at the output of a 50/50 beamsplitter as a function of the delay between two photons at the beamsplitter input . due to their bosonic nature the photons may bunch , giving rise to the characteristic dip in the coincidences . this interference effect will depend of the indistinguishability and purity of the photons and whether they are from the same , or independent , sources . therefore , the question arises as to what information concerning the indistinguishability and purity can be extracted from these hom - like interference patterns ? by focusing on the frequency degree of freedom , in this paper we discuss what information can be obtained from the interference patterns of different interferometers . we provide simple analytical formulas relating the spdc parameters with the characteristics of the interference patterns . such formulas can therefore be used to engineer photonic states with specific values of indistinguishability and purity . these are shown to be in good agreement with both experiment and numerical modeling .","we calculate analytically the spectral indistinguishability and purity of the two - photon interference pattern in spdc, a process where pairs of photons are generated by the interaction of a classical pump laser with a nonlinear crystal. we show that the visibility of the interference pattern obtained by comparing the arrival time of the photons to the delay between their arrival time and the coincidence frequency is unit, which provides a simple and intuitive understanding of the experiment. we also present calculations of the effect of a temporal delay between consecutive photons arrival at the interferometer. 99 j. hong, d. ou and m. mandel, ` ` interactions between light and atomic ensembles, '' nature * 424, * 817823 ( 2003 ). m. a. nielsen and i. l. chuang, _ quantum computation and quantum information _, ( cambridge university press, uk, 2000 ). p. g. kwiat, k. mattle, h. weinfurter, a. zeilinger, p. beuchert, m. lamare, r. mercier, n. f. ginzburg, and g. leuchs ` ` new high -

pair emission on the interference patterns has previously been detailed elsewhere @xcite . figure [ singlephoton ] ( b ) , it is reasonable to assume that an experiment is stable from pulse to pulse , such that successive photons are indistinguishable . one can see that there is a significant difference between the interference pattern obtained in a two - photon interferometer compared to the pattern obtained when two independent photons interfere , as described by and and illustrated in figure [ pur ] . these two equations are defined in terms of the spdc parameters and hence provide a means to engineer the photonic states with the desired indistinguishability and purity . in this paper we have also proposed a novel interferometric technique that allows for the purity to be measured using only a single spdc source . this greatly simplifies the experimental complexity , and more importantly , does not rely on any assumption that photons from independent spdc sources are indistinguishable .",0.1935483870967742,-0.06629748673663013

( ii ) a mean scale height of the sample is derived which is in agreement with the expected detection limit in the expected exposure time of the observations ( 100 - 150 pc at 5 kpc ) and ( iii ) a normalization of the luminosity function to the milky way is required in order to match the observed distribution of bolometric luminosities to the predicted one. the wolf - rayet star luminosity functions ( lte ) in supersoft sources are used to constrain the number of brown dwarfs. a supernova rate of a few per cent of the light elements ( i.e. nuclei ) exploding as a part of a supersoft population with a typical life time of about 5.5 to 6.5 years has been derived for this sample. this rate is large enough to make a significant contribution to the sn ia rate in the spiral galaxy. assuming that every supersoft source obeys the standard salpeter ( or scalo ) supernova survival rule and that no supernova is occurred on a timescale shorter than about 1 - 2 years, a normalisation for the supernova frequency in the galaxy is estimated to be about 1.5 per cent. the predicted distribution of presoft sources close to the galaxy disk and in the more spatially extended regions of its halo are consistent with the observed supersoft star count rates. the population size in the",0.19774718397997498,"supersoft sources constitute an interesting new class of x - ray binary sources ( cf . the observationally derived white dwarf mass distribution is compared with the mass distribution predicted from population synthesis calculations and the number of the population is corrected accordingly . . it has been shown by kahabka ( 1998 ) that the individual spectral parameters giving information on the white dwarf masses of these 16 m31 supersoft sources can be constrained if the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 and the count rate as given in the catalog of supper et al . the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 and the count rates have been compared with theoretical values derived using non - lte white dwarf atmosphere spectra . as a result we found that for all these 16 sources the white dwarf masses were quite large @xmath17 . in the present work non - lte models of white dwarf atmospheres deriving a mass distribution of a galaxy population is by far not trivial . in case of white dwarfs in supersoft sources objects are expected to be seen in the milky way with white dwarf masses in excess of @xmath2 after correction for the limited visibility due to the @xmath3 constraint and about 226 and objects in the twice as large m31 galaxy ( see section 3.3 ) . in the hydrogen - burning shell it thus seems that the supersoft x - ray sources can make a major contribution to the type ia sn rate in m31 . from the 1991 m31 x - ray point source catalog a sample of 26 candidate supersoft sources has been derived using one of the selection criteria @xmath116 or @xmath117 , @xmath118 and assuming that the observed count rate is in agreement with the expected steady - state luminosity . for these candidates absorbing hydrogen column densities , effective temperatures and white dwarf masses ( assuming the sources are on the stability line of atmospheric nuclear burning ) the observed white dwarf mass distribution of supersoft sources in m31 appears to be constrained to masses @xmath119 . this range of a population has to be compared with the range of a population of @xmath4800 - 5000 sources as predicted from population synthesis calculations . we find the source population scale height to be @xmath4300 pc for a scale height for the gas of 150 - 600 pc . this is consistent with a young stellar population . assuming a life time as a steadily nuclear burning white dwarf ( a supersoft source ) of @xmath13 and that all supersoft sources with masses in excess of @xmath6 are progenitors of supernovae of type ia , a sn ia rate of @xmath120 is inferred for m31 based on these progenitors . supersoft sources then comprise 20 - 100% of the sne ia progenitors for a total estimated sn ia rate of @xmath121 . a&a 322 , 431 chevalier r.a . , & plait p.c . , 1988 , apj 331 , l109 dickey j.m . , & lockman f.j . , 1990 , ara&a 28 , 215 distefano r. , & rappaport s. , 1994 , apj 437 , 733 distefano r. , 1996 , supersoft x - ray sources , lecture notes in physics 472 , springer , 193 ebisawa k. , asai k. , mukai k. , et al . , 1996 , see greiner 1996 , 91 evans nw . 165 , compact stars in binaries , ed .",0.2857142857142857,-0.08796710173431072

1004.0781,"in the last decade , numerous lyman - alpha emitters ( laes ) have been discovered with narrow - band filters at various redshifts . recently , multi - wavelength observations of laes have been performed and revealed that while many laes appear to be young and less massive , a noticeable fraction of laes possess much older populations of stars and larger stellar mass . how these two classes of laes are concordant with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not been understood clearly so far . in this paper , we model laes by three - dimensional cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a @xmath0cdm universe . as a result , it is shown that the age of simulated laes can spread over a wide range from @xmath1yr to @xmath2yr . also , we find that there are two types of laes , in one of which the young half - mass age is comparable to the mean age of stellar component , and in the other of which the young half - mass age is appreciably shorter than the mean age . we define the former as type 1 laes and the latter as type 2 laes . a type 1 lae corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy , whereas a type 2 lae does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy , as a consequence of delayed accretion of a subhalo onto a larger parent halo . thus , the same halo can experience a type 2 lae - phase as well as a type 1 lae - phase in the merger history . type 1 laes are expected to be younger than @xmath3yr , less dusty , and less massive with stellar mass @xmath4 , while type 2 laes are older than @xmath3yr , even dustier , and as massive as @xmath5 . the fraction of type 2s in all laes is a function of redshift , which is less than 2 percent at @xmath6 , @xmath730 percent at redshift @xmath8 , and @xmath770 percent at @xmath9 . type 2 laes can be discriminated clearly from type 1s in two color diagram of z-h vs j - k . we find that the brightness distribution of ly@xmath10 in type 2 laes is more extended than the main stellar component , in contrast to type 1 laes . this is not only because delayed starbursts tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy , but also because ly@xmath10 photons are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy . hence , the extent of ly@xmath10 emission may be an additional measure to distinguish type 2 laes from type 1 laes . the sizes of type 2 laes range from a few tens to a few hundreds kpc . at lower redshifts , the number of more extended , older type 2 laes increases . furthermore , it is anticipated that the amplitude of angular correlation function for type 2 laes is significantly higher than that for type 1 laes , but comparable to that for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . this implies that lbgs with strong ly@xmath10 line may include type 2 laes .

but in the nucleus , within a radius of 0.1 , it is likely that most of the mass is due instead to stars .","we present a study of the kinematic structure of the molecular gas in the luminous infrared galaxy ngc7469, based on a combination of high resolution radio co data and near infrared adaptive optics h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) data. the high spatial resolution of the co data taken with the adaptive optics system on the canada - france - hawaii telescope allows us to study the distribution of the gas with respect to the central 0.5 in the plane of symmetry of the galaxy. we find that the gas is kinematically connected to the nuclear ring on scales of 3.2 - 5.5 from the nucleus, and that it is oriented in the same plane as the bar and spiral arms seen in hcn. we therefore reject the possibility that the co and hcn lines trace different parts of the circumnuclear ring, although the latter do show some evidence for an asymmetrical distribution. the difference in position angle between the co ring and the nucleus on the basis of the hcn data is consistent with a bar - driven dynamical instability in the gas, and suggests that the ring and its nuclear ring are not located in a unique position angle @xmath1. the mass distribution in the co radio data is close to spherically symmetric, with both the major and minor axes distinctly non - axisymmetric. we have been able to constrain the mass inside a radius of 0.52.5 of the ring to be less than 4 times the mass of recently formed stars. utilising the scaling of the stellar light component, and using a model for the evolution of the mass surface density as a function of radius which describes the observed in p - v maps of the nuclear region, we derive a total dynamical mass of 6.8mx - 0.7 for the ring. this value is more than a factor of two above the total mass of stars and several times more than the mass in the ring observed in a k - band image of ngc1068, the only galaxy in which has been found to contain a nuclear ring which is strongly detected. the radial mass distribution we find is best described by a model in which accounts for all kinematics features except for the asymmetrical ring. with such a model we can explain the mass - to - light ratio and pah pah inclination of 2.3 in terms of a superposition of stellar and gas components. in particular, it provides a good match to the values found for the 1 -",0.19756097560975608,", we have constructed kinematic models which can explain the various features observed in the kinematic major and minor axis p - v maps , and which also estimate the rotation velocities inside a radius of 5 . as a starting point we have derived a single mass model which matches the kinematics from both the co radio data and the near infrared h@xmath0 spectroscopic data at their different resolutions . we have presented 0.7 radio co2 - 1 observations and 0.085 adaptive optics k - band spectroscopy of the central region of ngc7469 . using these data we have investigated the distribution and kinematics of the cold and warm molecular gas across nearly 2 orders of magnitude in spatial scale . additionally , we have studied the nuclear stellar cluster . the kinematics of the co2 - 1 and 1 - 0s(1 ) lines can be reproduced by an axisymmetric mass model consisting of a broad disk component , a circumnuclear ring at 2.3 , and a nuclear ring at 0.2 . the co2 - 1 morphology also suggests that there may be a bar or pair of spiral arms between the two rings , although there is no kinematical signature in the data . this may be because ngc7469 represents the case where straight shocks can not form along an inner bar , and hence there is no gas inflow . nevertheless , the increase in gas density in the bar / spiral may have triggered star formation and this is now seen as the knots of emission which lie inside the radius of the molecular ring . comparison of the dynamical and stellar masses indicates that molecular gas makes up more than half of the total mass within a radius of 1kpc , and that the remaining gas mass is at least several times that of recently formed stars in the ring . the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor is 0.40.8 times the galactic conversion factor . similar values have been seen a number of times in intense star forming environments . by mapping the stellar co absorption and considering the slope of the continuum , we have directly resolved the nuclear stellar cluster in ngc7469 . it is extended over 3060pc and contributes 2030% of the nuclear k - band continuum , and about 10% of the nuclear bolometric luminosity . the stellar mass counts for at least half , and probably more , of the total mass within 30pc ( 0.1 ) of the nucleus . the authors extend their thanks to the following people : jack gallimore and lowell tacconi - garman for considerable help with the co data , particularly calibrating and modelling the co1 - 0 data ;

1405.6084,"hybrid semiconductor - superconductor systems are interesting melting pots where various fundamental effects in condensed matter physics coexist . for example , when a quantum dot is coupled to a superconducting electrode two very distinct phenomena , superconductivity and the kondo effect , compete . as a result of this competition , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition when the superconducting gap @xmath0 is of the order of the kondo temperature @xmath1 . the underlying physics behind such transition ultimately relies on the physics of the anderson model where the standard metallic host is replaced by a superconducting one , namely the physics of a ( quantum ) magnetic impurity in a superconductor . a characteristic feature of this hybrid system is the emergence of sub - gap bound states , the so - called yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) states , which cross zero energy across the quantum phase transition , signaling a switching of the fermion parity and spin ( doublet or singlet ) of the ground state . interestingly , similar hybrid devices based on semiconducting nanowires with spin - orbit coupling may host exotic zero - energy bound states with majorana character . both , parity crossings and majorana bound states ( mbs)s , are experimentally marked by zero bias anomalies in transport , which are detected by coupling the hybrid device with an extra normal contact . we here demonstrate theoretically that this extra contact , usually considered as a non - perturbing tunneling weak probe , leads to nontrivial effects . this conclusion is supported by numerical renormalization group calculations of the phase diagram of an anderson impurity coupled to both superconducting and normal - state leads . we obtain this phase diagram for an arbitrary ratio @xmath2 for the first time , which allows us to analyze relevant experimental scenarios , such as parity crossings as well as novel kondo features induced by the normal lead , as this ratio changes . spectral functions at finite temperatures and magnetic fields , which can be directly linked to experimental tunneling transport characteristics , show zero - energy anomalies irrespective of whether the system is in the doublet or singlet regime . we also derive the analytical condition for the occurrence of zeeman - induced fermion - parity switches in the presence of interactions which bears unexpected similarities with the condition for emergent mbss in nanowires .","the connection between the physics of magnetic impurities in superconductors and majorana bound states ( mbs ) in the presence of quantum fluctuations is investigated in detail. a recent theoretical work considers a linear chain of anderson impurities on a superconductor as the minimal model that might explain the phenomenon of yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) bound states, that appear owing to pair - breaking effects that magnetic moments have on superconductivity. this mbs are predicted to appear as zero - energy bound states in effective spinless p - wave nanostructures, such as the ones resulting from the combined action of spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting in nanowire devices. we discuss how this picture is modified by the normal - state lead, which not only widens the sub - gap bound states into resonances of finite width, but also leads to additional kondo screening that generates an additional spectral peak pinned to zero frequency. this results in a significant change in the character of the zero - bias region in the phase diagram. using a diagonalization scheme, the critical temperature at which the zeeman energy of states above the gap @xmath0 for both normal and superconducting leads is determined. we find a condition for the system with a doublet - singlet cross - over between the ` ` singlet '' and ` ` doublet '' regimes that can be empirically distinguished from the case of a single site. we also provide an analytical expression for the condition for zeeman - induced parity crossings of states crossing the doublet at arbitrary ratio of the fermi energy, and provide a detailed derivation of the necessary for a non - bcs ground state, as well as for a topological phase transition to occur in this hybrid system. in addition, we study the effect of finite external magnetic field and external quantum fluctuations on the mbs and the mab parity system, and discuss the conditions for its existence and symmetry. the study of mbs proximized by proximizing quantum dots provides us with an important tool to understand the crossover from weakly interacting to strongly interacting systems. the complete phase diagram of this system is computed, which provides a complete picture of how the ysr bound states cross each other and can be reconciled with the shiba band picture of majorana states. the full set of results can be downloaded from the authors at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s037015731400",0.18230563002680963,"a characteristic feature of these systems is the presence of sub -

orbit coupling in the non - interacting regime : it has been shown that zeeman - induced parity crossings in short non - interacting nanowires ( with finite spin - orbit coupling ) smoothly evolve towards true topological transitions as the wire becomes longer . whether our interacting results are also smoothly connected with mbs physics in the finite spin -

free emission from the optically thin, optically thick, ejecta. we extend our model to include the effects of the white dwarf mass, chemical composition of the envelope, and the companion star thermal condition, which is widely applicable to optical and ir light curves of novae. a sequence of steady - state solutions for nova outbursts is calculated by considering the nova envelope to be in a steady state, after which time the envelope mass is decreased by the winds and nuclear burning. because the winds are driven by the strong peak of opal opacity, the wind - blown flux drops very quickly after the optical peak. this is because the energy generation during the wind phase depends on the total amount of cno but hardly on the chemical composition. we assume that c or o ( or ne ) is dredged up from the wd interior during the very early phase of the outburst and then mixed into the entire envelope by convection. we calculate optical and uv light curves by using the same method and also by applying it to three well observed novae, v1500 cygni, v1668 cyg, and v1974 cyg. we find that the optical flux is a good indicator of wd mass if we assume a single white dwarf. the turn - on time is the earliest part of the x - ray / turn - off time and is particularly important in the optical / uv band, because it is the longest and most variable of all parameters. except for the early in the outburst, the uv 1455 light curve is well fitted by a single template light curve having a universal decline law. we also find that in the ultraviolet band, the flux at the optical and infrared wavelengths is a power law with a photon index of 1.0. this suggests that the ultraviolet light curve of a typical nova may be composed of many components, i.e., many mag brighter in the early phase and less dense in the late phase, which may be reflected in the later uv and optical fluxes. we compare our model light curves with the _ iue _ and _ rosat _ data of v1624 cyg and v1455. we confirm that the former is a best -

astro-ph0010571,"with the recent publication of the measurements of the radiation angular power spectrum from the boomerang antarctic flight ( de bernardis et al . 2000 ) , it has become apparent that the currently favoured spatially - flat cold dark matter model ( matter density parameter @xmath0 , flatness being restored by a cosmological constant @xmath1 , hubble parameter @xmath2 , baryon density parameter @xmath3 ) no longer provides a good fit to the data . we describe a phenomenological approach to resurrecting this paradigm . we consider a primordial power spectrum which incorporates a bump , arbitrarily placed at @xmath4 , and characterized by a gaussian in log @xmath5 of standard deviation @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath7 , that is superimposed onto a scale - invariant power spectrum . we generate a range of theoretical models that include a bump at scales consistent with cosmic microwave background and large - scale structure observations , and perform a simple @xmath8 test to compare our models with the @xmath9 dmr data and the recently published boomerang and maxima data . unlike models that include a high baryon content , our models predict a low third acoustic peak . we find that low @xmath10 observations ( 20 @xmath11 200 ) are a critical discriminant of the bumps because the transfer function has a sharp cutoff on the high @xmath10 side of the first acoustic peak . current galaxy redshift survey data suggests that excess power is required at a scale around 100 mpc , corresponding to @xmath4 @xmath12 0.05 @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 . for the concordance model , use of a bump - like feature to account for this excess is not consistent with the constraints made from recent cmb data . we note that models with an appropriately chosen break in the power spectrum provide an alternative model that can give distortions similar to those reported in the apm survey as well as consistency with the cmb data ( atrio - barandela et al . 2000 ; barriga et al . 2000 ) . we prefer however to discount the apm data in favour of the less biased decorrelated linear power spectrum recently constructed from the pscz redshift survey ( hamilton & tegmark 2000 ) . we show that the concordance cosmology can be resurrected using our phenomenological approach and our best - fitting model is in agreement with the pscz observations . -0.5 in epsf cosmology : theory cosmic microwave background","we examine the possibility that the second acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is suppressed relative to the first acoustic peak based on recent boomerang and maxima data. we show that a phenomenological bump, arbitrarily placed at wavenumber @xmath0, can enhance the power spectrum amplitude around 100 mpc@xmath1, allowing for a baryon fraction greater than expected for a spatially flat universe such as the concordance model. we incorporate the bump into the primordial power spectrum by renormalizing the standard low - density cosmological model to the decorrelated linear power spectrum that was recently generated by ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ). we interpret the 22 decorrelated pscz data points as constraints on the bump parameters so that the theoretical model that we find to be the best - fit to the cmb observational data set can be compared with the galaxy survey observations. the choice of bump parameters is consistent with observations of large - scale power and cmb anisotropies. we find that with the chosen bump the model with a bias parameter of 1.07 ( hamilton & tegmark 2000 ) is ruled out at the 95 % confidence level, whereas the model without the bump takes a biasulus of 1. both models are a good fit to these up - to - date data sets, but the current data do not probe the scales that are critical to distinguishing between the models. we discuss the implications of our results for the scalelengths of adiabatic density perturbations in a model - by - model basis. # 1#2#3acta. phys. pol. * b#1 *, # 2 ( # 3 ) # 1 # 1 = = = cmr10 scaled2 = cmbh_s psfig.tex # 1 eq.

1301.4051,"_ there is a growing consensus among physicists that the classical notion of spacetime has to be drastically revised in order to find a consistent formulation of quantum mechanics and gravity . one such nontrivial attempt comprises of replacing functions of continuous spacetime coordinates with functions over noncommutative algebra . dynamics on such noncommutative spacetimes ( noncommutative theories ) are of great interest for a variety of reasons among the physicists . additionally arguments combining quantum uncertainties with classical gravity provide an alternative motivation for their study , and it is hoped that these theories can provide a self - consistent deformation of ordinary quantum field theories at small distances , yielding non - locality , or create a framework for finite truncation of quantum field theories while preserving symmetries . in this thesis we study the gauge theories on noncommutative moyal space . we find new static solitons and instantons in terms of the so - called generalized bose operators ( gbo ) . gbos are constructed to describe reducible representation of the oscillator algebra . they create / annihilate @xmath0-quanta , @xmath0 being a positive integer . we start with giving an alternative description to the already found static magnetic flux tube solutions of the noncommutative gauge theories in terms of gbos . the nielsen - olesen vortex solutions found in terms of these operators also reduce to the ones known in the literature . on the other hand , we find a class of new instanton solutions which are unitarily inequivalent to the ones found from adhm construction on noncommutative space . the charge of the instanton has a description in terms of the index representing the reducibility of the fock space representation , i.e. , @xmath0 . after studying the static soliton solutions in noncommutative minkowski space and the instanton solutions in noncommutative euclidean space we go on to study the implications of the time - space noncommutativity in minkowski space . to understand it properly we study the time - dependent transitions of a forced harmonic oscillator in noncommutative 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime . we also provide an interpretation of our results in the context of non - linear quantum optics . we then shift to the so - called dsr theories which are related to a different kind of noncommutative ( @xmath1-minkowski ) space . dsr ( doubly / deformed special relativity ) aims to search for an alternate relativistic theory which keeps a length / energy scale ( the planck scale ) and a velocity scale ( the speed of light scale ) invariant . we study thermodynamics of an ideal gas in such a scenario . _ in first chapter we introduce the subjects of the noncommutative quantum theories and the dsr . chapter [ instanton ] starts with describing the gbos . they correspond to reducible representations of the harmonic oscillator algebra . we demonstrate their relevance in the construction of topologically non - trivial solutions in noncommutative gauge theories , focusing our attention to flux tubes , vortices , and instantons . our method provides a simple new relation between the topological charge and the number of times the basic irreducible representation occurs in the reducible representation underlying the gbo . when used in conjunction with the noncommutative adhm construction , we find that these new instantons are in general not unitarily equivalent to the ones currently known in literature . chapter [ qo ] studies the time dependent transitions of quantum forced harmonic oscillator ( qfho ) in noncommutative @xmath2 perturbatively to linear order in the noncommutativity @xmath3 . we show that the poisson distribution gets modified , and that the vacuum state evolves into a ` ` squeezed '' state rather than a coherent state . the time evolutions of uncertainties in position and momentum in vacuum are also studied and imply interesting consequences for modelling nonlinear phenomena in quantum optics . in chapter [ dsr ] we study thermodynamics of an ideal gas in doubly special relativity . we obtain a series solution for the partition function and derive thermodynamic quantities . we observe that dsr thermodynamics is non -
